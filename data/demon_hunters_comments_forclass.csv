"Just a reminder, apologies are for those affected not for the ones who did the wrong doing. No one has to forgive them, and honestly they were bad apologies. 

Ya’ll always try to make the idols who did racist sht out to be the victims; instead of the people who had to go see those they supported treat their race like a costume and mock them. 

I wasn’t expecting them to disband; cause honestly most people in these spaces don’t care about black people. They’ll always have people like you who demonize anyone who is bothered. Who can always site the idols being bullied; but have nothing to say for the racism black/brown fans had to experience from the artist and their fans. I knew they’d be fine and continue on from the start. I assure you many other black fans did as well. I think all anyone was hoping was that more growth would be had than excuses; and not even addressing the people they offended. They’ll continue on fine. But no one has to like them, or get over the crap they did. 

P.S. Before words get put in my mouth; I’ll never condone bullying. But acting like that’s the only thing going on here is in bad faith.","mq2of37","Mercury-Goblin","t3_1kcavlt","t1_mq2bz6u",1746128690,23,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kcavlt/kiss_of_life_special_digital_single_kiss_road/mq2of37/",2025-05-01 19:44:50,2025,5

"Well, that is why it is desadventageous for NJWS, one of the things,  they have to be careful when arguing in court is not to sound as if they were aware of of MHJ conspiracies, and that she is not behind all their actions since they started this crusade, bc that is tampering. One of the adors' arguments is that MHJ is manipulating the girls. 

One thing is the girls saying that they want to work with MHJ bc it was their mentor and  core of their identity and other thing is actively conspiring with her to get out of the contract with ADOR/HYBE or even the takeover of ADOR MHJ was planning.

So, when the topic of MHJ comes in the trial, as they have the same lawfirm, confirm of interest could happen and either the lawyers stay quite, basically giving the victory of that point to ADOR  or they argue putting MHJ in a bad place and creating a precedent against her in her lawsuit 

They can be one team, but ultimately they are being sue in different things, but the topics could easily intertwined, and arguments that are beneficial for NJWS  are not for MHJ and vice-versa, bc as individuals every single one of them could have had the same goal, making them a team,  but not participated in the same way which means that for example, one could be gulty of tampering but the other not, and the only way to demonstrated that is throwing the other person under the bus ergo why you need other lawfirm","msyowo3","Fast-Ad-6897","t3_1kf7rre","t1_msyeqk5",1747580241,31,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kf7rre/megathread_22_hybe_ador_mhj_we_reach_one_year_of/msyowo3/",2025-05-18 14:57:21,2025,5

"Agreed about the cultural differences even within the same religion! I certainly had no idea about the variations between European countries. Thank you for the interesting glimpse into the culture there.

In Korea, the Catholic Church has often been at the forefront of pro-democracy and social justice movements, fighting for the poor, the laborers, and the disabled, among others. Not perfectly progressive on all fronts for sure, but definitely more than many others. Very ""for the ordinary masses.""

I think it is also definitely more relaxed when it comes to religious practices (as in, not as in-your-face, fervent, hellfire-and-brimstone as some other denominations, preferring quiet, meditative aspects over loud demonstrations of faith).

Of course, this doesn't hold for all Korean Catholics - some people become Catholic for the supposed ""prestige"" associated with it, the short version of the explanation being that Catholicism in Korea has long been associated with the ""educated""/intellectuals due to the history of how it was mostly brought over by Korean scholars rather than by foreign missionaries. Though clearly, as this whole Karina situation shows, not all Korean Catholics are... um... socially or politically aware 😬

Furthermore, the judge would still have recognized intent even if the clause was absent from the contract, provided that ATTRAKT could demonstrate it paid for the copyright by giving The Givers funds for ownership at any moment. But, Attrakt couldn't show any evidence.

It is a big issue, when it's impacting people. Let's count the amount of people actually hurt by the stream, ready? 0...0...0...0... Oh right it was 0 people.

Implying that it did hurt people actually takes away from the times when someone does really hurt someone. Because right now people just look like clowns complaining about nothing. 

It's not grown ups living in the real world who had an issue with what they 'did'. It was perpetually online, young people who haven't met real challenges in life yet. People who are looking for someone to step the tiniest bit out of line to take out their frustrations on, and what better target than attractive successful people. Cause unlike the people complaining the group have something to lose.

"To be honest? I actually agree that new ador and old ador was probably not the same. After all, the key ppl change, however NJS mistake is to things, they didn't actually let ador 2.0. Demostrate they couldn't promote them and make good music to keep their concept and essence, they are arguing that they didn't have actual plans or that in 6 months they didn't bring a new producer or brand director to replace MHJ, but MHJ quit... after being offered the job and stall for months, and they started their riot right away. They should have at least make a comeback without any MHJ involvement to actually argue that. What it is even funnier is the fact that they key ppl that left was all bc MHJ basically took them with her or supported her, so i think is pretty contradictory defend so much mhj here.

The other point is the fact unless their contract state about working with specific ppl then there is no reason for them to void the contract base on that. And as ador 2.0. Argue, they didn't joined hybe bc of mhj, they were going to belong to the hybe umbrella regardless if it was ador or source. 

Now, in general, the line between ador 1.0 & ador 2.0, it's very thin. After all, ador 2.0. Still have to respond for 1.0. Mistakes and messes, so  let's say njs finally throws MHJ under the bus and use her actions to demonstrate damaging practices ador 2.0 would have a higher chance to lose, bc they are virtually and legally the same company. Of course, part of it can be deflected to MHJ, and argue that they took action by firing mhj, which they are already establishing, but bc njs does not blame MHJ, the point becomes in favor of ador 2.0","mwmzk5d","Fast-Ad-6897","t3_1kf7rre","t1_mwmg9vv",1749380890,41,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kf7rre/megathread_22_hybe_ador_mhj_we_reach_one_year_of/mwmzk5d/",2025-06-08 11:08:10,2025,6

[**NewJeans' Appeal Against Independent Activity Ban Dismissed… Court Rules ""No Breakdown of Trust Relationship"" (Comprehensive Report)**](https://n.news.naver.com/article/003/0013308924?sid=102) 

The members of girl group NewJeans filed an immediate appeal against the court's provisional disposition order prohibiting their independent activities, but it was dismissed. **The appellate court ruled that there was no evidence of a breakdown in the trust relationship between ADOR and NewJeans.**

On the 17th, the Seoul High Court's Civil Division 25-2 (Presiding Judges Hwang Byung-ha, Jeong Jong-gwan, and Lee Kyun-yong) **dismissed the appeal filed by all five NewJeans members against the provisional disposition order that upheld ADOR's request to preserve its agency status** and prohibit the members from independently signing advertising contracts.  

The court of first instance had previously ruled in favor of ADOR in March, granting its request for a provisional disposition to preserve its agency status and prohibit the members from signing advertising contracts without authorization. NewJeans members subsequently filed an objection and an appeal, but both were dismissed.  

The appellate court stated, **""If the debtors (NewJeans members) unilaterally withdraw from the exclusive contract and engage in independent entertainment activities, the creditor (ADOR) would suffer severe disadvantages, including the loss of all investment returns. Conversely, the debtors would unjustly monopolize all future benefits from their entertainment activities by completely excluding the creditor, leading to an unreasonable outcome.""** 

The court also **rejected the argument that former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin should oversee NewJeans' production.** The judges noted, **""The exclusive contract does not stipulate that Min must remain as ADOR's CEO or that she must oversee the debtors' production.""**  

They further explained, **""Min's removal as CEO was solely due to conflicts between HYBE and Min over management rights and other issues. This does not constitute a breakdown of the 'trust relationship between the creditor (ADOR) and the debtors (NewJeans members)' upon which the exclusive contract was based.""** 

The court also **dismissed NewJeans' claim that the trust relationship had collapsed,** stating, **""The reasons presented by the debtors do not amount to circumstances that would lead to a breakdown of trust.""** 

Additionally, the judges emphasized, **""Given that the creditor (ADOR) continues to maintain trust in the debtors despite their refusal to cooperate, there is no objective evidence to support the claim of a trust breakdown. The legal requirement for 'breakdown of trust' cited by the debtors as grounds for contract termination has not been met.""**

The appellate court added, **""Until the main lawsuit regarding the validity of the exclusive contract is concluded, it is reasonable to provisionally uphold the creditor's status as the management agency and prohibit the debtors from engaging in independent entertainment activities, as the necessity for preservation has been sufficiently demonstrated.""** 

Under procedural rules, the opposing party in a provisional disposition case must first file an objection before appealing. NewJeans' objection was dismissed in April.  

The Seoul Central District Court's Civil Division 50 (Presiding Judge Kim Sang-hoon), which granted the provisional disposition, stated, ""ADOR is provisionally recognized as the management agency for NewJeans members under the exclusive contract,"" and ordered, ""NewJeans members must not engage in any entertainment activities—whether independently or through third parties—without ADOR's prior approval or consent.""  

As a result of the provisional disposition, NewJeans is prohibited from activities such as composing, producing, performing, appearing on broadcasts, negotiating or signing advertising contracts, or engaging in commercial activities without ADOR's approval.  

The conflict between the two parties escalated last November when NewJeans announced the termination of their contract, citing ADOR's breach of obligations.  

At the time, the members held a press conference and sent a formal demand letter calling for Min Hee-jin's reinstatement and other corrective measures. They argued that ADOR's refusal to comply had destroyed the trust relationship. Despite this, they stated their intention to proceed with scheduled activities and advertisements independently.  

In response, ADOR filed a lawsuit in December with the Seoul Central District Court to confirm the validity of the exclusive contract with NewJeans, followed by the provisional disposition request.","my8ee9h","thetari","t3_1kf7rre","t3_1kf7rre",1750151337,71,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kf7rre/megathread_22_hybe_ador_mhj_we_reach_one_year_of/my8ee9h/",2025-06-17 09:08:57,2025,6
"Yup. The members have not acted in good faith. None of their actions have demonstrated this. We in this megathread have mentioned this over and over. Their early termination press conference (before even getting Ador response) and their refusal to return Ador’s phone calls look hella bad and always did. I never understood that.  They never even attempted to reconcile/negotiate with Ador. Courts like it when you at least try to meet your legal obligations. Only after you tried can you argue it was just too much to bear.","myflkkg","Bear4years","t3_1kf7rre","t1_myf2q4d",1750247551,27,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kf7rre/megathread_22_hybe_ador_mhj_we_reach_one_year_of/myflkkg/",2025-06-18 11:52:31,2025,6
"It's a question of pettiness, i.e, how much damage does Ador want to inflict, because NJ have handed themselves over on a platter. I would not be surprised if at the minimum, they ask NJ to testify against MHJ.


It's also a question of what looks like adequate consequences to the Hybe shareholders and investors. However much fans think these battles are about them, they really are about demonstrating to shareholders that a company can do what's needed to enforce contracts. Those are conversations none of us are privy to.


ALL of this depends on the members conceding that they could lose and need a Plan B. I'm not holding my breath. I just hope they realise that at least a few people at Hybe are probably relishing the opportunity to go all out against them.","myh8umh","wannabewabisabi","t3_1kf7rre","t1_myh2rxl",1750265818,14,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kf7rre/megathread_22_hybe_ador_mhj_we_reach_one_year_of/myh8umh/",2025-06-18 16:56:58,2025,6
"Thank you to u/anyincident9852 for compiling the Google doc on the court's findings. As I've said before, it's a shame that people refuse to acknowledge the exact details of the court's decision and prefer to make up their own stories because this appeal was a SLAM DUNK on NJs flimsy arguments.

The members are more than willing to engage in high profile advertising activities, which was the first thing they tried to secure before leaving Ador. NJ only care about money, they are not trying to protect their ""artistic freedom"" and I'm tired of people pretending they are.

These are my fave points:

>if NewJeans unilaterally terminate the exclusive contract for this case during the contract period or violate an important provision of the contract with the intent to unilaterally terminate it, NewJeans shall pay ADOR, in addition to damages, a penalty equal to the average monthly sales during the period in which actual sales were generated during the two-year contract period immediately prior to the date of termination of the contract, multiplied by the number of months in the remaining contract period.

It's interesting to hear that the terms of their exclusive contract were negotiated, so there is no way the members and their parents (lawyers) missed or did not seek to clarify this part of the contract before signing. The potential penalty is so high, I can't imagine overlooking it. 

>Footnote 8: Min Heejin worked as a producer at 'SM Entertainment' and then moved to HYBE (see Soeul Evidence No. 13). It appears that many of the idol groups that Min Heejin was involved in producing at 'SM Entertainment' continued to have successful activities through collaborations with other producers even after Min Heejin left the company.

Ador submitting this as evidence is pretty hilarious. The argument didn't make sense anyway because MHJ outsourced pretty much everything.


Footnote 9: Even according to NewJeans' claim itself, the ILLIT members greeted Hanni Pham when they first met, and this fact can also be seen in the CCTV footage (Exhibit No. 99) submitted as evidence for this case (the ILLIT members also seem to have greeted Danielle Marsh, who was walking down the hallway across). Even according to NewJeans' claim, the fact that the ILLIT members did not greet Hanni was only a one-time thing and that the ILLIT members repeatedly greeted NewJeans, who were senior idol group members.

The courts acknowledged that even if the ""ignore her"" was true, NJs only claim that it occurred ONCE, and this doesn't demonstrate that there was ongoing animosity between the two groups because Illit had greeted them multiple times. I don't think I've seen anyone mention this point and it makes me even more angry that NJ continuously mentioned the Illit members as a reason to terminate their contract.","mylfkjy","Tuon_Cauthon","t3_1kf7rre","t3_1kf7rre",1750319100,105,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1kf7rre/megathread_22_hybe_ador_mhj_we_reach_one_year_of/mylfkjy/",2025-06-19 07:45:00,2025,6

I think some of them will go back. I don’t think all of them will. Hanni is dunzo. I think Minji is done. I suspect Danielle is done.

I do think there is a faction of their fans who want them at ADOR just making music. We’ve seen that recently with some demonstrations in SK with the pleas saying that the members were bearing the most significant consequences in what was essentially an adult disagreement.

"Yeah I think a lot of his fans are being kind of ridiculous. He should absolutely fight against the prostitution allegations, because those are unfounded, but his fight against the company isn’t over those. While fans might believe whatever he’s saying, they can’t expect the general public to, because to them it’ll look like “Well he was such an asset, they wouldn’t fire him for NO reason, and why was he hanging around with those types anyways?” Obviously I disagree with the demonization of those (particularly women) that do or have done sex work, and this sort of narrative is unproductive and outdated, but it’s still the dominant perspective. As an idol, hanging out with even a *former* adult film star is a huge no, and this has unfortunately been the precedent for years now. Whether we like it or not, whether he actually slept with her or is dating her or not, mass backlash was always going to be the result of them being seen together getting out.

* Spending her evenings at home screaming
* Making a tote bag for bunnies but couldn't afford the minimum order amount
* Astral projection
* ""I don't drink! I don't go out and party!""
* The k-pop industry is creatively stifling and her way of doing things is better
* Freelancers
* ""I didn't swear at the press conference!""
* Being obsessed with (and feeling a connection to) the bipolar character on the TV series Homeland

**YG BABYMONSTER, Pre-Comeback Double Joy... Achieving Million-Seller in 1 Year After Debut**

[News N Hwang Hye-jin Reporter] 

The group BABYMONSTER has achieved their first million-seller with their first regular album 'DRIP' approximately 1 year after their official debut.

According to YG Entertainment on June 27th, BABYMONSTER's 'DRIP' recorded a cumulative sales volume of 1,011,352 copies. This comes about 7 months after its release on November 1st last year.

Previously, the first regular album 'DRIP' quickly showed popularity signals upon its release. The initial sales were 677,961 copies, 1.7 times higher compared to 'BABYMONS7ER', and recorded 820,000 orders a week after release. They have since steadily increased sales to achieve million-seller status.

As album sales volume is considered one of the core fandom indicators, it vividly demonstrates BABYMONSTER's steep rise. Their overwhelming live performance skills, proven across global broadcasting stages including their ongoing debut world tour, are interpreted as a catalyst for global fandom expansion.

Additionally, with active activities planned for the latter half of this year, the final sales volume is expected to increase. BABYMONSTER will release 'HOT SAUCE' on July 1st, their second single in September, and a mini-album in October. They will also expand their connection with music fans by performing at Japan's largest music festival 'Summer Sonic' on August 16th.

BABYMONSTER's new song 'HOT SAUCE' is an old-school hip-hop track capturing the vibe of the mid-to-late 1980s. A refreshing charm that will coolly color this summer has been previewed.

They plan to heat up the comeback atmosphere by sequentially releasing performance videos and dance practice videos on YouTube.","n00og74","Asleep_Swing2979","t3_1llmcrj","t3_1llmcrj",1751003657,0,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1llmcrj/babymonster_have_achieved_their_first/n00og74/",2025-06-27 05:54:17,2025,6

"Guys I thought we figured this out already!! Saja boys weren’t a real group, they were used to promote huntrix. First time we see them there were reports of huntrix being in the crowd, when they go on the tv show huntrix is there again to solidify their collaboration and make sure the saja boys get more of a fanbase- they even do a fansign together!  

Then during the idol awards huntrix stages a breakup that ties into their concept of being ‘demon hunters’ where the other hunters turn on rumi and reveal she has the demon marks all the demon actors have in their other performances. Then the saja boys put on a concert afterwards and drop one hell of a single while also showing that they are a whole band of demons that reveal themselves once huntrix is ‘gone’, so huntrix comes together again during that concert to defeat them and makes up. Best collab I’ve EVER seen- and all of that to reveal rumi’s new full body tattoos was amazing planning from their pr team.   

So basically, Saja boys are technically just a huntrix spin off- makes sense as to why they would give up their 5 year streak of winning the idol awards so easily if they’re technically still getting it","n178sva","xXPhoenixTheLizardXx","t3_1lqvkyd","t1_n16txt9",1751578598,36,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lqvkyd/kpop_demon_hunters_will_submit_original_song/n178sva/",2025-07-03 21:36:38,2025,7

What I would like to ask is if there is a chance of a prequel?

I know a lot of people are hoping for a sequel but I’d love to go back and get a deeper dive into each of the girls past. They are all quite interesting but really want to understand how Rumi’s father is a demon. But also the family dynamics for Mira and Zoey’s introvertness and her writing.

- Would you say that your experience working on Wish Dragon helped you to create Kpop Demon Hunters, in terms of directing or otherwise?

- Are you really focused on highlighting the experiences of asian cultures in animated features, or was it pure coincidence that your two directed animated movies just happened to be based on chinese and korean characters?

"Hi! Thanks so much for doing an AMA, really looking forward to hearing your answers to some of these!

I really enjoyed Kpop Demon Hunters, the music choices were absolutely incredible! What I wasn’t fully expecting going in was how deeply the story would resonate with me, especially Gwi-ma exploiting shame and the overall moral that shame poisons us against ourselves and our loved ones, and that the way we free ourselves of it is by bringing it into the light and facing it. I’ve been in therapy for ptsd for a while, and so much of it is dealing with shame and learning how to dispel it, and honestly when I do visualization stuff with shame it always looks…demonic.

So anyway, my question is: How did you decide to center in around shame, and what went into presenting it in a way that would resonate widely?

If there is ever a sequel or a continuation of some sort, will there be more world exploration? Im really interested in seeing possibly other countries if huntrix ever goes on a world tour or even if we get a better look at where the demons are if they're ever touched on in more depth.

Will there be physical DVD releases? I would absolutely buy them.

Do you guys plan on focusing more on Huntrix's relationship (as well as the girls individually)? I personally adore the trio and hope they remain the focus when it comes to general relationships

"Hi! Congrats about the success of your movie!!! 🎉🎉🎉
I’ve got a few questions if you don’t mind me asking/

1) Were you all expecting the movie to be such a big hit before release? I know I wasn’t as similar shows on Netflix such as Jentry Chau vs. the Underworld did not gather such traction so it really makes me happy to see KPDH topping so many charts that I’ve lost track at this point.

2) I’m sure you know about the exponentially growing demand for more Huntr/x. Could we get a hint on if+how+when we can get more content?

3) I read somewhere online that the original cut for the movie was 3hrs but Netflix made y’all cut it down. Is this true and if so is there a possibility of said cut content seeing the light of day?

4) In the world of KPDH most human characters have black hair except Rumi and Mira. Rumi having purple hair makes sense since she is half-demon and it allows her to stand out but Mira breaks the rule so are her hair naturally that color or does she dye them as the rebellious diva that she is because her parents have black hair?

5) Rumi has never heard Gwi-ma in her ears even after Mira and Zoey pulled their weapons on her. Does her demon half make her immune to Gwi-ma or why did dhe never fall susceptible to his influence?

6) There was concept art of Rumi’s parents. Will we potentially learn about they met+what happened to them. 

7) We don’t see the Honmoon turn gold at the end. Is the new Honmoon just not supposed to be golden or was that left so for future explorations?

8) Does Celine finally accept Rumi for all she is or she still stuck in her beliefs at the end of the movie?

9) There was a lot of speculation about whether Jinu took the bracelet from Derpy at the end or not so could you please confirm it?

Wow this got way longer than I was expecting. Sorry 😭
But I hope you still try and answer some if not all of these questions🙏 (pretty please 🥺)","n28wnmz","ShiningCS","t3_1lvk3gu","t3_1lvk3gu",1752094665,4,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n28wnmz/",2025-07-09 20:57:45,2025,7

"Hello everyone!! Congratulations on the success of KPOP Delon Hunters and thank you so much for doing this q&a!!

For Maggie Kang mostly but also to everyone:

• At the end of the film, we see Zoey wearing a yellow Derpy hoodie as well as the new HUNTR/X billboard with Rumi’s patterns showing!! How much time passes between the final battle, the bathhouse, and the final scene? 

• This is more of an observation than a question: The final performance happens at midnight but when the Honmoon becomes new, the sky becomes early-mid morning!! So did the girls speed up time through their powerful ballad? That’s pretty cool if so!!

• Speaking of the Derpy hoodie, I’m assuming that Rumi told Mira and Zoey about them and now they permanently live with them in the penthouse while still going through portals? In the end credits, we see a cute animation of Mira and Sussie glaring suspiciously at someone and that’s really cute!! How did Mira and Zoey react upon seeing them? And how long did it take for Zoey to make that adorable hoodie?

• I heard you guys were definitely interested in doing more with Zoey and Mira’s backstories for a future sequel!! I would love to see Zoey visiting Burbank with the girls or Mira using her people-reading skills to figure something important out!! I think Zoey and Mira are both excellent characters and I can’t wait to find more out about them!!

• At the beginning of the movie when the girls are introducing Zoey, the youngest of the group, she’s seen writing the lyrics for ‘How It’s Done’ and that’s super cool!! I noticed Zoey was inside a school building though with people walking!  She’s also in the empty school building for the ‘Golden’ music video! Is Zoey taking credit classes there or was it just a stage prop set?

• At the second week of Music Bank when ‘Golden’ wins and the girls start to do their choreography for a few seconds, Takedown wasn’t officially made yet but judging from their tough and cool looks, I’m assuming they’re performing ‘How It’s Done’ there maybe (?) and that is also like a tamer diss track to the demon boy band!! 

I also ask this because one of the fans said before the Idol Awards start that they can’t wait to hear ‘Golden’ live so was she just not there if they did perform it at the Music Bank or did she just want to see it live again? 

• Have you ever thought of putting out a full HUNTR/X album? The four songs they have out right now are incredible and I would love to hear more!! I also would love acapella versions of the other songs and maybe some acoustic versions too!!

• We know a lot of information about Rumi’s mother and Celine but what about third Sunlight Sister? She looks very pretty and I would love it if we could know her name!! 

• When Jinu betrayed Rumi and publicly humiliated her on stage, how did Rumi really feel about it? Does she have some resentment from not having control over the situation or does she forgive him because he was being manipulated by Gwi-ma and knew it wasn’t the real him and just his demon talking even though it was still his idea? 

• For Free, some of the lyrics sound romantic but I’ve seen a few people say they saw it in a platonic way of two newfound friends singing about their shared shame over their patterns!! Both interpretations are good but is there one you prefer over the other? 

• During the final battle, Rumi’s sword gets upgraded into Phrase 2 when Jinu gives his soul to her and it looks really cool!! Do you think Mira and Zoey’s weapons could get upgraded one day too or are they fine as they are at the moment?

• When are the girls’ birthdays and also their ages? I keep imagining Rumi as 24 since she would be 19 when HUNTR/X first formed and won the idol awards for 5 constructive years!! Mira would probably be 23 and Zoey 22?

During the scene where Jinu proposes his plan, we saw Mystery had larger demon teeth before transforming into the demon form he uses in the finale. Did all of the Saja Boys have more extreme demon forms that just didn't get shown?

•What happened to Jinu’s soul after he gave it to rumi and powered her up? Is his soul still able to have a comeback? 

•will we soon be able to have more background of rumi’s parents? Especially how her mother passed away?

•After rumi was able to accept her patterns and so did the girls at the end, what happened to Celine? Does she end up accepting it or will it be her trying but struggles to see rumi for herself instead of her “father’s side” ? 

•Will there be an art book in the future? I’ll love to see the progress this film took from the beginning to the final product! 

•I noticed at the end during the final battle some of the saja boys disappear before being hit by the hunters weapons. Does this mean they’re still alive and teleported? or more to come into future? 

•does K-pop demon hunters have a chance Turing into a book series or maybe a graphic novel? If it does will it go more into detail?

•will there be any future projects planned out after how successful this film did on Netflix?

I want to thank everyone who was involved making this film. I love the way it was animated smooth yet choppy but in a good way! It’s so unique compared to other films that have been coming out. It’s like a breath of fresh air getting something different instead of similar stories or predicable plots. The movie it’s self giving this film more life, I know many people who are giving K-pop a try after watching this film, I once considered myself a K-pop listener. I mainly stayed with watching kdrama’s but after watching K-pop demon hunters it has reignited my love for kpop. I again want thank everyone who were apart of the team that helped make this movie and also help have Maggie’s creativity come to life. We love you all so much :) 🫶🏼

(Sorry for so many questions and words. I myself am an artist who has my own characters with their own stories and it makes me happy watching other artists successfully have their characters be seen by many people.

2. Why was Jinu’s family not allowed to come live at the palace with him?
3. I noticed that humans civilians can see demons, as shown in How It’s Done, but believed that was “special effects”. They also cannot see the Honmoon, and don’t have an adverse reaction to Rumi’s demon markings. I was wondering how much human civilians actually know of demons and the demon world?

"Could you touch on some of the lore and background information about the world of K-pop Demon Hunters? A few questions I have in particular: Who is the third Sunlight Sister and what happened with her that left Celine alone to raise Rumi? Was Celine singlehandedly maintaining the honmoon between Miyeong's passing and the debut of Huntr/x? Are the Saja Boys the idols from the picture in the quack doctor's office? How do the hunters determine which weapons they wield? Is that a personal choice or something that just manifests for them? Is Rumi her real name or a stage name and did she take her mother's surname Ryu as hers too?

As an aside, this film is sort of a culmination of everything I know and love and it's resonated significantly with me. I got into k-pop in the early 2010's, thanks to Girl's Generation, and due largely in part to that discover, when I got to university, I ended up majoring in Asian Studies with an emphasis on Korean history and culture. Heck, my senior thesis was even on Korean alcohol and their drinking culture, believe it or not. But I also majored in Screenwriting as a second degree as it had always been my dream to work in the film & TV industry as a writer. I sort of gave up on that dream post-COVID and have secretly regretted not trying harder in the years since. And I guess seeing KDH sort of lit a fire in me to just try and see what I could do in terms of writing a fan-sequel so to speak, and so for the last few days I've been drafting and outlining what could be a possible storyline for what might be a follow-up to your first film. Hence the above are a few questions I had that would help to clarify parts of said fan sequel. I know this is such a long shot and unlikely to even be seen, let alone go anywhere, but if there's any chance I'd be able to just shoot over the treatment I've written for my interpretation of what comes next, it would mean the world to me.

"I love the movie and all the Music... it took over my life. I can only hope this is the beginning of a fantastic journey for the characters, the team behind the movies, and us in the audience. Hopefully, it won't take too much of a toll on my credit card. I have a few questions, and if they are topics you plan to cover in future installments or if you don't want to answer them because you don't have a decision, you don't have to respond.

1. If a sequel is approved, do you guys already have a storyboard of what you want to do? (don't need to give spoilers) I know you mentioned in an interview there were many more stories to tell, but do you have a base idea for the next movie, or would you need to start from ""scratch"" to create the main story.

2. We saw that when Gwi-ma absorbs a soul, a demon is created. Are they different from the demons that wear black hats like Jinu? Are all the demons that have the black hats fallen humans, or did Jinu happen to take that form when he fell? Is there a hierarchy among demons, or is it just Gwi-ma at the top? Example: Are the black hats and larger demons captains to other demons, or are all demons equal to each other but subordinate to Gwi-ma?

3. Before Huntrix was completely formed and ready to fight, who was battling demons, or were they just free to eat souls? Is there a group related to the Hunters who hold the line against the demons, while the hunter trio of that generation is formed and trained since all the trios were kids at some point? Or does the previous generation cover for them until they are ready?","n2bb3mx","RegularSafety5366","t3_1lvk3gu","t3_1lvk3gu",1752125232,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n2bb3mx/",2025-07-10 05:27:12,2025,7

I do have a couple of questions, though!
First off:

1. Why KPop Demon Hunters? What inspired the idea behind this specific concept? It’s honestly something I’d never think of putting together! ❤️

2. If possible to answer, were there other original plot/concept plans that were put aside in the creative writing process? ✨

3. Would we ever get a chance for a sequel/prequel/series, if possible? 👀 The love for this movie has been so strong, but we should acknowledge that it would be TONS of work for the team behind this masterpiece. Or, would you say this chapter for HUNTR/X has been completed? 

4. What did you guys inject into this movie that is so ADDICTING? I think we can all agree that every song on the OST is playing in our heads 24/7 😂

"Sending love from KOREA🇰🇷
One Korean fan shared a theory that quickly went viral among local fans: Mystery is a Sapsali (a traditional Korean breed believed to ward off evil spirits), Abby is a Dokkaebi (Korean goblin), Jinu is a Grim Reaper, Baby is a child ghost, and Romance is a bachelor ghost. Many fans are curious about the true identities and pasts of the Saja Boys.

"Thank you so much for creating KPDH! I absolutely loved every part of it, especially the soundtrack and the animation. I’m really hoping we’ll get to see a sequel someday. 💜

I’ve had a few questions on my mind since the movie came out: 


1. How exactly does the honmoon work? For example, if it turns gold, does it automatically pull all demons on the surface back into the demon realm? Or would any demon still outside the realm when it seals remain behind, leaving the Huntrix to track them down and kill them to send them back manually under the gold honmoon? This question came up because, if I remember correctly, Rumi’s plan was to get Jinu’s help and keep him on the surface before sealing the honmoon, so I was wondering if that would’ve worked.

2. Did Celine know for sure that turning the honmoon gold would remove Rumi’s patterns? How?

3. Have you ever considered turning KPDH into a limited series?


Thanks so much!","n2bn1xu","kaeya_x","t3_1lvk3gu","t3_1lvk3gu",1752131508,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n2bn1xu/",2025-07-10 07:11:48,2025,7
"1: In the timeline of events did Jinu make a deal with Gwi-ma before or after the first hunters created the Honmoon

2: Can Gwi-ma still gather souls like Jinu's with the Hon-moon active or has he not feasted at all since it was implemented. 

3: There's a theory going around that Gwi-ma manipulated Jinu's memories is that true or did Jinu actually abandon his sister and mother?

4: Another theory going around is that part of the reason Jinu had to abandon his family due to the time period and that if he refused then the king would kill him and possible his family, is that correct or was that not a factor in Jinu's decision?

"Question for Maggie:  As a Korean growing up in Canada, I assume you grew up reading Anne of Green Gables.  As you may already know, Anne is an immensely popular cultural export to Korea and Japan, even having inspired popular manga series like Candy Candy.  During the 1970s, nobody was concerned whether manga writers were misrepresenting American culture; rather there seen as an outsider's expression of longing and admiration for another culture.  With the onset of K-Pop Demon Hunters, the reverse phenomenon is happening: Westerners are wanting to write stories within an Eastern cultural context.

"Sorry I can't be here, because of exams, so here's my avalanche of qs lol  
general  
\- are they fans of KDA? Do they know them?  
\- will additional content be movies, series and or comics? prequels? sequels? sidestories? slice of life?  
\- is the multicolour honmoon semipermeable? (unlike the golden which seems to be an absolute filter)  
\- got heights and ages (even if just intended ranges) for us?  
\- do any of them play video/console games? do we have a gamer girl?  
\- prospects of jinu coming back / existing in the sword or something? his story seemed like it ended to me, but many have hopes lol  
\- did the trio adopt sussy and derpy?  
\- their favourite colours?  
\- do they wield only one type of weapon or can they switch things up?  
\- are all tree fluently bilingual or is this a well the movie is in english moment? i thought they were with the tiny korean moments here and there (i love hcing rumi and mira learning english through zoey and them helping zoey with korean if she didn't attain fluency in her childhood)   
\- personally figured with their hunter occupation that the girls would be buffer/more athletically built or is this just an animation style moment and they actually all are lean built...who win at arm wrestling? (would rumi still win without the demon side boost?)  
\- would Mira and Zoey accepted her if Rumi told them early on / some time into the friendship? I figure Zoey absolutely would with how I experienced her character and her seemingly not discunting the possibility of nice demons (even if it was a comic relief moment)  
\- anything athletic they do except zoey and her skateboard?  
\- seen any headcanons you personally agree with? (there's this thread from (at) AJ\_something\_ on twitter for example I 100% agree with XD)  
\- do they ever do live streams?  
\- which discipline would each of them participate in in the ISAC?  


I absolutely adore the movie and all the work that went into this project from every person be it the producers, animators or the VAs and have been positively inhaling KDH which hasn't happened to me now for 14 years with literally Avatar.  
Every bit has touched my heart and soul in so many ways, it's clear this was made with love and passion 

also so sorry there's this much! XD ofc not all - or any for that matter - have to be answered I'd really appreciate it though!  
person specific questions will be in seperate comments (apparently this is too long)","n2c4o68","MikeyIa","t3_1lvk3gu","t3_1lvk3gu",1752141569,0,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n2c4o68/",2025-07-10 09:59:29,2025,7
"Rumi  
\- so what about that bi eyeliner?  
\- was there actually romantic shenanigans between her and jinu or more of a deep trust and friendship born from an inherent understanding of something deeply hidden in the movie? I know cut content included that aquarium date, but in the movie as is they never pegged me as a romance direction  
\- does her head/neck ever hurt from all her hair?  
\- can she still teleport like she did before facing gwi-ma?  
\- will she outlive everyone or does she retain a human lifespan?  


Zoey  
\- accidental or purposeful audhd coding?  
\- does two lives hint at diaspora, divorce or both?  
\- if she skates, does she also surf? perhaps climbing too?  
\- fruity perhaps?  
\- how come zoey can make her shin-kal float and follow her hands? or is that a too deep just enjoy her being cool moment? XD  
\- did she get bullied in highschool? the too much and not enough also rings like that for me esp. with her having believed her musical escapades were weird and useless  
\- please tell me Zoey is actually instelligent and just a goofball gremlin full of whimsy XD  
\- I'm guessing her love language is touch, ye?  
  
  
Mira  
\- potential lesbinem or am I reading too much into how this fabulous diva carries herself?  
\- wild as in acting out / not like high social standing or is there more to Mira being a ""problem child""?, she does call herself hyper aggressive...  
\- with rumi playing the guitar and zoey the piano/keyboard does Mira play anything?  
\- she's a total softy on the inside, isn't she? but only towards special people and the fans I bet  
\- linking to the stream q: thoughts on my hc that Mira does lives on occasion while doing her makeup?  


Celine  
\- is her insistance on covering up etc. generational trauma or her own baggage that bled into the hunter teachings and carried over when she trained the next gen? ya know from all the demon boyfriend stuff which must have caused serious conflict (especially with the cut content of celine having killed rumi's mom)  
\- saw awesome art in which mira and zoey painted patterns on themselves which rumi absolutely delighted and celine looking like she's entering a crisis. They would, woudln't they? How is celine taking all of the recent events actually? will we find out in more content or can we get some insight for now?","n2c4pbm","MikeyIa","t3_1lvk3gu","t1_n2c4o68",1752141586,0,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n2c4pbm/",2025-07-10 09:59:46,2025,7

Hello! First of all congratulations for all the achievements this movie has achieved so far like #1 on NETFLIX, soundtracks on the billboard100 and i heard that Golden was submitted for the Oscars? Its craaaaaaazy and all your hard work was sooo worth it 🥰 Shoutout to everyone who worked on the film, the directors, artists (I’ve been binging the concept arts and experimentations I’ve been seeing all over Instagram they are so GORGEOUS, the voice actors and the crew in charge of producing, writing and singing the beautiful soundtracks 😁

Questions:
1. I think one of the most interesting character in the show is Celine. Of course all the characters in the show are all complex in their own ways but Celine is the epitome of complexity i feel! I just wanted to know if there is a chance that celine’s backstory would be explored in the sequel/prequel/part 2 that will (HOPEFULLY) come out

2. Another lore aspect i wanted to ask is if we will get to explore the Saja Boys’ backstories? While i understand that the other 4 Saja Boys’ existence was for the boy group to exist in the first movie, i do still wanna know more about them like how they were as humans (or if they were even human at all 👀), the Saja boys’ bootcamp that Jinu may or may not have organised just to teach the choreography for soda pop and your idol????

3. What were some inspirations for the character designs? I think from the different concept arts the artist posted, it was interesting to see that out of the 3 huntrix members, Rumi’s braid stayed consistent in almost all drawings while Zoey and Mira’s hairstyles changed around a lot. What made you think ‘Yes! This is the hairstyle for Zoey and this is for Mira”? (Also i absolutely love Zoeys hairstyle her micro bangs suits her a lot.

4. Amongst all the Huntrix members, who is the best fighter? Or are the girls equally good but with different strengths (EG; Mira: Brute force, Rumi: demon strength, Zoey: agility/assassin)

5. Lastly, would there be opportunities in the next film/series for the franchise to look into Zoey and Mira’s backstories more in-depth?

Other than that, congrats again and LETS HOPE FOR A PART 2!!!!","n2cr6r1","sodasodapoppop","t3_1lvk3gu","t3_1lvk3gu",1752151360,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n2cr6r1/",2025-07-10 12:42:40,2025,7

"Congrats on the success, I really loved this movie! But there are a lot of things that were left unanswered or leaving me with questions.  
\-like how did Jinu set up his plan? Did he study kpop and its culture, are the Saja boys randoms demons he picked out, who wrote their songs, did they hypnotize people to be under a company?   
\-Do demons die or are they sent back to the demon world like Zoey sort of claimed.   
\- And my biggest question, what happened with Celine and Rumi after their confrontation at the end, was Celine being genuine about her love and was just going about the patterns all wrong, is she also getting used to Rumi's new life accepting her patterns, or did their fight break their connection?  
\-What has been your favorite part of seeing this movie blow up, is it all the trends, the fan art or the memes people have been making?

"Congrats on how successful the movie and soundtrack has been! I have quite a few questions so if my comment gets used, you don't have to answer them all.


-Will a longer version of the song Jinu played at Gwi-Ma be released(with the beginning speaking part included if possible)? 


-There are a lot of different fan theories of what exactly happened at the end with the Honmoon, Jinu, Romance, and Mystery. Are you able to clarify on any of that, at least with the Honmoon? Are the demons sealed or have their souls been guided to an afterlife to Rest In Peace? And when Huntrix kills a demon, do they fully die or just go back to the underworld?


-Can we get more specifics on demon lore and how they collect souls? There's no contract or agreement.

"Dear Maggie Kang,   
\- How do you feel with so much love this film is receiving!!!!!!!!!!!!! Did you have some sleepless nights feeling all the love?!!!!!! or maybe were there sleepless nights during the production, out of storyline/filmmaking concerns?

Dear Maggie Kang, Chris Appelhans,

\- On Instagram, many animators and artists involved in the film have been sharing their work and their pitch ideas that were not confirmed. And they are all SO talented. I would be mesmerized by all the cool ideas. How did you go about deciding how should the film's art/story go every step of the way? 

\- What does being a animation film director mean? What was important to you?

\- Bobby, Mira and Zoey also reveal their dark/demon thoughts in their head, them not believing in themselves. 

""**Demon Bobby:** You couldn't keep them together. You're all alone, but you don't have to be.  
**Demon Mira:** You thought you've found a family? You don't deserve one. You never have.  
**Demon Zoey:** You're too much. And not enough. You'll never belong anywhere, but I can give you a place to belong.""

Could you talk about shaping this part in the story?  I feel like these also must have been very relatable to a lot of people. 

Dear Maggie Kang

\- Also, people on media pronounce your last name Kaeng, but I doubt that's correct. : O Isn't it KAH-ng? I just want people to know it if that's the correct pronunciation.   


Dear Ian Eisendrath,  
Could you share about your work process? Weaving music into film, working with all the soundtracks, singers, songwriters in the film, it’s sounds like A LOT!  
Any interesting episodes that you still think of ? : )  
Danny Chung gave thanks to everyone involved in film production on Instagram, and also mentioned you, and said he learned “so much about how music shapes a film"" from you. Could you talk about this? : ) what is “music shaping a film” for you?

Dear Anyone,  
Unofficial question off the record----Could you please tell Netflix plushie ordering manager to come up with V.2 of Derpy the Tiger plushie? Really cute and really bright blue like in the movie? The official merch Derpy is, no offense, kinda scary.....

  
Dear everyone,

"Congrats on the big success of the movie and soundtrack!!!

  
Obviously all us fans would love more content from the franchise, in the form of sequels, prequels tv-series etc. and we know those take A LOT of time and money to make. So my question is:

  
Would you perhaps consider making and releasing comics, to flesh out the characters, the lore, the side stories etc? Avatar The Last Airbender found a lot of success in continuing their franchise in comic form, and I think that could be a great idea for the Kpop Demon Hunters universe too! Opening up to being able to make a lot of side stories and lore, for both the Huntrix and the Saja Boys, without the same time and money movies and tv-series require!

\- i love the jokes and funny moments in the film. How did you go about throwing them in the story? I saw the reel from Maggie's husband ""but one of those snowflakes is probably the best"" was his idea! (Yes, Im very invested in finding the KPDH content and behind the scenes online)

\- I'm really curious about the collaborative process behind the project. With such a big team working on this project, how do you navigate creative disagreements and work together to build a shared vision? Were there any moments when strong differences actually led to something even better? 

\- what were the other challenging moments in production, if not mentioned in anwering the above question?

\- what are some songs you love to listen to? K-pop and other genres? Who are some of the artists/songwriters you love? :) and of course, all the soundtracks in KPDH are living in my head daily.

But looking back, I realized every word in the title is so deliberate. Putting 'K-pop' right up front is such a bold move.

"It is actually considered a serious betrayal of the fans that Rumi and Jinu meet to manipulate the rankings of the Idol Awards. After it is revealed that Rumi is a half-demon, I believe this is the context behind Jinu saying, “We are demons, all we get to do is live with our pain, our misery.” 

But surprisingly, people failed to catch how serious the wrongdoing committed by the two was, or what kind of bond their shared sense of guilt created between them—and what’s even more surprising is that, despite this, there was no difficulty in understanding the story.

  
Was the omission of any depiction of guilt in this part intentional on the director’s part? Or is it that people don’t find it strange to believe Rumi must live with being a demon just because of that the patterns?

"hiya i hope i'm not too late and haven't missed the AMA! it must be so wild to see the reception towards the movie! what's something that surprised you the most?

also i do have a hypothesis about why the movie has been such a huge success and expanded beyond the usual kpop audience - i think kpop demon hunters is definitely a fantastic entryway for non-fans, considering that there's catchy songs (in mostly english!), memorable characters/idols, and overall it just feels more accessible? thinking back to my own kpop journey, there have been times where i was completely overwhelmed by the notion of bias, bias wrecker, music shows, music show voting, dance practice, encores, fandoms, fanwars etc... i love that the movie is a bit more streamlined and less overwhelming, plus watching one movie with a broad spectrum of songs is easier than checking out let's say 5 different artists! i'm so so so happy to see how the movie resonates with people of all ages and backgrounds.

last but not least, i really, really, really hope to see more from this universe, whether it's movie sequels/prequels or even a show! i love all the nods to kpop and korean culture (i nearly died when melomance's love, maybe started playing haha, i was like IT'S BECAUSE AHN HYO SEOP WAS THE MALE LEAD OF BUSINESS PROPOSAL!) and i feel like there's so much in this world to play with. we only got to see two groups, but surely there's more groups? maybe we can learn more about the previous hunter trios? 

okay this is the LAST THING i'll say, but i also really enjoyed reading [EJAE's interview with genius korea](https://genius.com/discussions/500181-Interview-ejae-on-writing-the-hits-and-singing-for-rumi-in-kpop-demon-hunters)! i'm having a blast absorbing everything KPDH related, so keep it coming <333","n2e43rx","crowlily","t3_1lvk3gu","t3_1lvk3gu",1752165828,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n2e43rx/",2025-07-10 16:43:48,2025,7

"Hello! I'm blind and use a screen reader to read and type! I love this movie with all my heart, even though audio description kinda messed with the songs it just means I get to listen to the movie over and over.  You're all amazing!!

Is the rumour of the movie originally being 3 hours anything at all? I'm sorry its hard to find information as I'm blind and it's best just asking the team themselves 

What the characters sexualitys in your mind?

How old was Rumi when her patterns first showed? And can she use her demon powers at will now she's embraced them?

Are the saja boys dead or just back in the demon realm? And in jinus case in the sword. Audio description did not make that clear.

What would huntrixs favourite songs be?

We know jinu was human 400 years ago but do we know what time period the other saja boys were from and hypothetically could someone make a deal with gwi ma in the modern day pre huntrix beating him? What time period is the movie set at, what year? Presumably close to ours since Twice exists in the KPDH universe.

Also since Twice exist does that mean that technically mean that any other real world people could be in KPDH? Like- twice and huntrix and saja boys fans exists in both worlds and presumably because Twice is there fans are technically getting their souls taken? This is moreso a hypothetical based on me over thinking. I sincerely apologise for rambling this movie means a lot to me

"While I respect this response and understand the desire to introduce new characters into the setting, and it would be interesting to see other demons, I don't think it's one that I or many others like. 

Many of us who saw the film adored the Saja Boys. They are unquestionably a major reason for the film's success. As a result, and again, while I understand the want to introduce new characters, I believe that leaving the Saja Boys in the state they were in at the end of the film is a bit of a waste, for lack of a better word.

At the very least, I believe most of us would be satisfied with a prequel in any form that shows how the Saja Boys came to be, as well as fleshing out their characters and relationships to explain why they appear to be so close before moving onto something else. Alternatively, would it be possible to introduce new characters alongside bringing back already established fan favorites? 

I don’t know. I just feel like the Saja Boys had potential that could be explored and we all would be tuned in to see, and just leaving them behind to move onto other characters would be kind of sad.

"**KPop Demon Hunters tidbit from the article:**

The *KPop Demon Hunters* soundtrack climbs 3-2 — a new peak — in its third week, earning 75,000 equivalent album units (up 21%). It’s the first soundtrack to debut in the top 10 on the Billboard 200 and then see unit increases in its second and third weeks since the *Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Vol. 2* album in 2017.

In the 2020s, only four soundtracks have reached the top two on the Billboard 200: *KPop Demon Hunters*, *Wicked* (which debuted and peaked at No. 2 in 2024), *Barbie* (also No. 2 debut and peak, in 2023) and *Encanto* (nine weeks at No. 1 in 2022).

Of the *KPop Demon Hunters* soundtrack’s 75,000 units earned in its third week, SEA units comprise 70,000 (up 24%, equaling 96.33 million on-demand official streams of the set’s songs — it holds at No. 2 on Top Streaming Albums), album sales comprise 4,000 (down 6% — it rises 21-9 on Top Album Sales) and TEA units comprise 1,000 (up 6%).

As the *KPop Demon Hunters* soundtrack racked up 96.33 million streams for its songs in its third week, it scores the biggest streaming week for a soundtrack in more three years. The last soundtrack to post a bigger streaming figure was *Encanto*, on the March 12, 2022-dated chart, when it rang up 101.16 million streams for its songs in its eighth week at No. 1 on the Billboard 200.

*KPop Demon Hunters* premiered on June 20 in a limited theatrical release in the U.S., and on Netflix, alongside its soundtrack. In the tracking week ending July 6, *KPop Demon Hunters* held at No. 2 in its third week on Netflix’s Top 10 Movies in United States chart.

"huge audience reach in a way that even the most successful K-Pop songs just can't reach sometimes (a movie + language), it's not really a genre of music that exists strongly outside of K-Pop so townies are only just realising this, and on it's own it's an extremely well-written song!! One thing the K-Pop Demon Hunters soundtrack did was that each of the (profilic) songs really played lyrically into their song theme — the drink motif in Soda Pop, the shining/eternalising theme of Golden, the hypnotic parasocial idol in Your Idol, and ""the song we couldn't write"" in What It Sounds Like"", etc. They sacrificed a bit of nuance in the Korean lyrics but that was to be expected. 

With Golden specifically, it doesn't have the same ""victorious"" outset as I Am, namely, because I Am is a song about having *already won* and celebrating your victory lap. Meanwhile, Golden is a song about the excitement of your approaching victory, and all the emotions tied up in it. It is for these same reasons that Golden is slightly more emotionally charged than I Am is, and this is partly because EJAE's voice absolutely sells this! She is fantastic at what she does and whilst I am not drawing comparisons between her and IVE's best vocalists, the majority of the song being just her helps with carrying that emotion. The big part that sells Golden (which is a section I'd argue that I Am lacks, and I am an I Am defender!) is that final post-chorus/outro (""You know we're gonna be, gonna be golden, we're gonna be, gonna be,"" etc.) really pushes the emotions of the song to the maximum. I'm not trying to change your mind on the song, it's just my thoughts on why it's a song that so many people are enjoying!","n31qg91","gsc777_pkc","t3_1lzch29","t1_n31oswq",1752485796,19,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lzch29/golden_by_huntrx_ejae_audrey_nuna_rei_ami_from/n31qg91/",2025-07-14 09:36:36,2025,7

"[A bit more detail about the court's reasoning:](https://m.entertain.naver.com/home/article/108/0003347556)

At the time, the court stated,  
**“Based solely on the arguments and materials submitted thus far, it is deemed that HYBE has not sufficiently substantiated the reasons for dismissal or resignation that it claims.”**

However, it added,  
**“It is clear that Min Hee-jin sought ways to remove NewJeans from HYBE’s sphere of control or to pressure HYBE in a way that would weaken HYBE’s control over ADOR and allow her to independently control ADOR.”**

It continued,  
**“Nevertheless, it is difficult to conclude that she went beyond the stage of exploring such methods to actual implementation, and while such actions by Min Hee-jin may be considered a betrayal of HYBE, they cannot readily be deemed a breach of fiduciary duty against ADOR.”**

The court emphasized,

“Considering that the general shareholders’ meeting is imminent, that it would be difficult for Min Hee-jin to receive relief through a main lawsuit, and that the damage of losing the opportunity to perform her duties as a director constitutes irreparable harm that cannot later be compensated by monetary means, there is also a demonstrated necessity to restrict HYBE’s exercise of its voting rights.”

"I agree. Huntrix are the main characters (the movie is literally called kpop demon hunters). I feel like people have been focusing too much on the SJB, especially cause they are attractive. In the end, besides Jinu, the rest were there as side characters with no other information apart from their nicknames. I personally believe that if they weren't attractive, they would nt have been as popular. It definitely helped that they were inspired by Stray Kids, BTS, Monsta X (if im not wrong). All these big kpop boy bands. In my experience in the kpop world, a great majority of people heavily favour boy bands. Also is applied to criticism. Boy bands aren't normally criticised as much as girl bands (and I must say, lots of this criticism comes from girls). I think that's why they chose the Saja Boys to be, well, boys. They are demons, the bad guys (Jinu is a bit more debatable), but based on the kpop world, the creators knew people would like them. I do wonder, if the roles were reversed (Huntrix are the Demons and Saja Boys are the hunters) if people would have the same focus on the demons as they do now.","n3abvbb","PlasticCertain2113","t3_1lvk3gu","t1_n2pdxew",1752596871,2,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n3abvbb/",2025-07-15 16:27:51,2025,7

"I'm currently shocked by the amount of negative comments here. I really enjoyed this Twice album. It's one of their best in a long time while being different from what they usually offer. Its also one the best POP album i listened to in 2025.

The album is perfectly sonically coherent and pleasant to listen to on repeat or in shuffle mode. This shows how well structured it is, which is rare in K POP. In general, K POP groups have good title tracks but incoherent and sometimes bad albums that go in all directions. 

As for This is for, I really enjoyed the song even if it's not the best on the album. The song is in English and is short but doesn't sound incomplete or like a demo. On the contrary, for a short song I found it surprisingly good and the Extended version is even better. 

My only complaint is why the extended version of This Is for isn't on the physical album and why the KPOP Demon Hunters song isn't either. The fact that they released a deluxe version right after the standard version with only two additions unavailable physically is my only criticism. 

In addition, I know that all the wonders that are on this album will never have clips or live performance or video performance because despite all the money that Twice brings in to JYPE they only have the right to an MV in general. 

I really hoped that Like it, Like it from the album Strategy would have an MV especially since it almost became a title track but JYPE does not bother to do this for TWICE. While even small groups like Kiss of Life have several videos per album. Anyway, that was my opinion and I am really surprised to see so many negative opinions.","n3akcwb","Muted-Feeling-9260","t3_1lwx6lm","t3_1lwx6lm",1752599173,2,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lwx6lm/twice_this_is_for/n3akcwb/",2025-07-15 17:06:13,2025,7

LJM already has the perfect target, he already has the founder of Kakao Kim Beom-Su who is currently on bail as a perfect target with his links to LSM and SM. A few of Kakao's subsideries are also under investigation for various reasons. There has already been enough evidence to arrest him, much stronger case. He's a bigger and easier target and his conviction would send shockwaves in SK as Kakao are highly influential in banking, media, etc. Prosecution could easily create media attention to Kim Beom-Su if they wanted to.

If LJM does decide to go after BSH, it would be egg on his face if it goes wrong and it's more likely influence in the ministry as they have already demonstrated their willingness to get their hands dirty with the National Assembly and that was before LJM.","n3hlrxn","East_Eye_5582","t3_1m0bzjz","t1_n3gw4kn",1752690421,14,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n3hlrxn/",2025-07-16 18:27:01,2025,7

[**Belift Lab States, ""If ILLIT is Considered Plagiarism, Then NewJeans Could Also Be Just a Copy"" [ST On-Site]**](https://v.daum.net/v/20250718174502525)

Belift Lab, the agency of girl group ILLIT, has refuted the plagiarism allegations raised by former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin against ILLIT.  

On the 18th, the 12th Civil Division of the Seoul Western District Court held the third hearing for the 2 billion won damages lawsuit filed by Belift Lab against former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin over defamation and business interference.  

Last April, when HYBE initiated an audit, former CEO Min Hee-jin countered that the conflict arose because ""ILLIT copied NewJeans,"" claiming, ""ILLIT is copying NewJeans in every aspect of their entertainment activities."" In response, Belif Lab stated, ""We clearly assert that this is untrue,"" and filed this lawsuit in June of last year.  

During the first hearing on January 10, Belift Lab argued, ""The core of the defendant’s unlawful act is 'targeting coordinates.' They are setting relatively defenseless rookies, who could become potential competitors, as targets for attack and pushing their claims. The defendant themselves have also been embroiled in plagiarism disputes.""  

Former CEO Min Hee-jin’s side emphasized that all statements made during the emergency press conference in April of last year were for public interest purposes and argued that they do not warrant the damages claimed by Belift Lab.  

At the second hearing on March 7, the court instructed both parties to submit written arguments within 30 pages and limit their PowerPoint presentations to two sessions, each lasting 30 minutes. Accordingly, both sides agreed to present their positions on key issues, such as choreography and hanbok concepts, via PowerPoint.  

On this day, Belift Lab proceeded with their presentation first. Belift Lab stated, **""The essence of this case lies in the defendant’s act of 'targeting coordinates.'** When HYBE and ADOR’s audit began due to the defendant’s attempt to seize management control, the defendant held a press conference, claiming their actions were due to copying. **They began attacking ILLIT and the plaintiff using provocative language.** The defendant is a star producer with a long career, and NewJeans is a top-tier girl group with a solid fandom. **Because of the defendant’s remarks, ILLIT, who had only debuted a month prior, was branded as a plagiarist group and subjected to attacks.""** They further argued, **""The defendant is framing their press conference statements as being for public interest, but they are solely pursuing personal gain.""**  

Additionally, they stated, **""The two groups are girl groups with distinct identities. During ADOR’s injunction case, whether the plaintiff copied NewJeans was also a point of contention, but the Seoul Central District Court ruled that it was difficult to sufficiently substantiate, and the High Court dismissed NewJeans’ claims. The defendant frequently cites online communities and presents them as evidence.""**  

They then elaborated on the differences between ILLIT and NewJeans, stating, **""There are clear distinctions between NewJeans and ILLIT across concept, music, choreography, and debut approach.""**

Regarding concept, they explained, **""NewJeans follows Y2K and retro styles with a natural mood and no separate worldview. ILLIT has built a dreamlike concept of princesses and magical girls with its own distinct worldview.""** On music production, they noted, **""NewJeans works with a single production team and hip-hop-based music, while ILLIT involves multiple producers and pursues a pop sound.""**  

Concerning their debut strategies, they said, **""NewJeans adhered to a mystique approach before surprising the public with a music video release, whereas ILLIT was formed through a public TV audition and maintained consistent pre-debut exposure via YouTube.""** Regarding choreography, they stated, **""NewJeans emphasizes freestyle movement, while ILLIT focuses on precise group formations and storytelling-driven choreography.""**  

They further remarked, **""They are girl groups with entirely different images and identities. Ironically, when NewJeans faced 'Bubblegum' plagiarism rumors, the defendant demanded that claims be supported by credible evidence. Now, it is we who must explain why the plaintiff is not guilty of plagiarism. For ILLIT, which has suffered immense damage from these false plagiarism accusations, the very fact that they must prove their innocence is itself a great hardship.""**

They continued to point out the flaws in the defendant's plagiarism claims. First, they argued, **""They deliberately ignored the facts,""** stating, **""It is evident that they predetermined plagiarism and constructed their copying claims accordingly.""**

Belift Lab addressed NewJeans' project proposal, stating, **""Because differentiation from Belift Lab would have been difficult, they stated they would avoid survival show formats. Instead, their first official appearance was a brand beauty event ten days later. ILLIT, however, conducted a public survival audition and opted for a strategy of consistent exposure. The defendant appears to have been aware that the debut methods were different.""**  

Regarding the hanbok photoshoot, they said, **""They claim ILLIT copied them, but many other artists have also taken hanbok photoshoots at palaces,""** listing examples of other artists.  

**As the second issue with the defendant's plagiarism claims, they brought up the ""Min Hee-jin's Theory of Everything.""** Belift Lab stated, **""Min Hee-jin's side submitted comment sections as evidence of copying. Branding something as plagiarism based solely on intuitive impressions suppresses free artistic competition and development. NewJeans' 'Bubblegum' also faced plagiarism suspicions before. The defendant countered at the time, saying, 'The similarity lies only in a brief phrase progression, which is a commonly found type of lyric.' The defendant clearly understands that only the creative portions, excluding public domain elements, should be compared.""**  

They further pointed out, **""In the case of choreography, the movements the defendant claims were copied are all individual moves belonging to the public domain and freely usable. If exclusive rights were granted for such movements, it would enable plagiarism claims against all choreography, severely restricting creativity. The defendant’s written argument even claims that sitting poses constitute copying, demonstrating just how unreasonable their claims are. If the defendant’s press conference is justified, it would be akin to granting them a hunting license for idol groups.""**  

Belift Lab then **provided examples of other artists who had used the hair-flip, arm-swinging, and sitting movements pointed out by the defendant,** arguing that **these movements existed both before and after NewJeans.**","n3sa72a","thetari","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1752829723,56,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n3sa72a/",2025-07-18 09:08:43,2025,7

[**""If ILLIT Plagiarized NewJeans...Then NewJeans is Just a Copy of GFRIEND"" [Star Field Report]**](https://m.entertain.naver.com/home/article/108/0003348648)

**Girl group ILLIT's side pointed out contradictions in the claims made by former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin, who produced NewJeans.**

On the 18th, the 12th Civil Division of Seoul Western District Court held the third hearing for the 2.5 billion won damages lawsuit filed by HYBE Labels against Min Hee-jin.

During the hearing, ILLIT's side addressed Min Hee-jin's claims that everything from the use of COEX outdoor billboards to selfies in front of the Eiffel Tower and standing in a straight line formation were all copies of NewJeans. **""If we follow the defendant's logic, then NewJeans' concept photos would ultimately just be copies of someone else's work,""** ILLIT's side stated. **""Let us be perfectly clear - we are not at all suggesting that NewJeans copied other idols. Rather, we're demonstrating that by Min Hee-jin's own standards, NewJeans could similarly be dismissed as merely copying earlier idols.""**

To support this, ILLIT's side **presented evidence comparing similarities between NewJeans and girl group GFRIEND.** They noted that several elements - the editing technique of switching from 16:9 high-definition to 4:3 low-definition mid-music video, full shots of girls playfully crossing a bridge, and school-uniform concept music videos - were all first showcased by GFRIEND 5-6 years before NewJeans.

Other elements like advertisements shot against ocean and sky backdrops with red structures and props in identical compositions, the hanbok concept photoshoots Min Hee-jin specifically mentioned, group photos in similar poses wearing white-toned outfits, and dreamlike concept photos with comparable aesthetics were also previously implemented by GFRIEND.

**""Just as NewJeans isn't considered a copy of GFRIEND simply because of some overlapping elements, the same applies to ILLIT not being a copy of NewJeans,""** ILLIT's side argued. **""They shouldn't be disparaged as such. These are things that Min Hee-jin, with her long industry experience, should know well.""** They expressed bitterness at how Min Hee-jin had exaggerated and distorted coincidental similarities into claims of intentional copying.

Previously, at an April press conference, Min Hee-jin had publicly disclosed conflicts with HYBE chairman Bang Si-hyuk and other executives, alleging that HYBE debuted LE SSERAFIM as its first girl group instead of NewJeans and blocked NewJeans' promotions until after LE SSERAFIM's debut. She also accused ILLIT of ""stealing NewJeans' concept.""

In response, LE SSERAFIM's agency Source Music filed a 500 million won defamation lawsuit, while ILLIT's agency Belift Lab filed a 2 billion won damages suit, claiming Min Hee-jin's statements harmed their artists.","n3sfft5","thetari","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1752832673,42,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n3sfft5/",2025-07-18 09:57:53,2025,7

"I don’t know the entire story but from what I’ve seen, it seems like the creators of Kpop Demon Hunters took some inspiration from IVE with some of their songs (specifically Golden) and scenes.

But some fans have noticed that the creator has been reposting and crediting other groups for inspiration.

But fans have noticed that IVE has received no acknowledgment when the overlap seems clear.

Although I’m just relaying the message, I have no idea how true this is.

"For those wondering why MHJ's legal team is using online comments for her side of the case, remember that the suit BeLift filed is [over defamation and business interference.](https://v.daum.net/v/20250718174502525) Part of proving defamation is showing that the reputation of the plaintiff was damaged due to actions taken by the defendant. This is where social media comes into play.

Sejong needs to demonstrate that in the month of time between ILLIT's debut and MHJ's press conference, the narrative that ""ILLIT copied NewJeans"" was already established. Basically, this is their way of proving that MHJ was not responsible for ILLIT being branded as copycats. If the court sees that ILLIT's reputation was already that way before hand, then it won't count as defamation because people were already thinking that way. It would be more effective to target the source of the narrative, and Sejong is saying it wasn't MHJ.

This is part of how news sites can get away with reporting falsehoods sometimes. Most articles and stations don't claim the idea as their own, but frame it as reporting on what is being said, or if it's a legal dispute, they make sure to say ""allegedly"" when talking about a crime that someone hasn't been convicted of yet. It's towing the line by essentially saying ""I didn't come up with it, it was already going around."" The news, or in the court's case, the claim of plagiarism, doesn't have to be true, it just has to be what people were already thinking. The idea is that you can't damage an already damaged reputation by making a statement that's already popular opinion.

So yeah, it's stupid to listen to online comments when the comments in question are coming from stans that accuse everyone of copying their faves, but at the same time, it did effect how people think. Cmiiw, but I've seen it said that defamation suits are easy to win in South Korea, so I expect that, even if the judge decides that MHJ is not chiefly responsible for ILLIT being accused of copying, that she still did considerable damage because, as BeLift is arguing, she had negative intent and as an industry veteran, she knew exactly what she was doing by lying and stirring the pot. Perhaps they can also get her on business interference if the judge accepts that her words damaged ILLIT in an observable way therefore effecting the brand and company. It'll come down to if the judge believes MHJ's actions starting with the press conference really made things worse.","n40v6cs","SageSageofSages","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1752944543,37,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n40v6cs/",2025-07-19 17:02:23,2025,7

[**[Aftermath of the Commercial Law Revision] HYBE Faces the Task of Resuming NewJeans' Activities Amid 'Duty of Loyalty to Shareholders'**](https://n.news.naver.com/article/293/0000070125?sid=105)

**As the duty of loyalty for directors under the revised Commercial Law has expanded from the company to include the company and all shareholders, HYBE's board of directors is grappling deeply with the issue of resuming activities for the idol group NewJeans.** The situation arose after NewJeans members announced a temporary halt to activities in March, which has also hindered ADOR's ability to generate new revenue.  

**The exclusive contract dispute that led to this crisis has negatively impacted HYBE's consolidated performance and corporate credibility, potentially harming all shareholders.** Since HYBE's board of directors sets the management direction for subsidiaries, including ADOR, a swift resolution is required.  

According to HYBE on the 22nd, the exclusive contract dispute between ADOR and NewJeans has escalated into a legal battle. NewJeans is a group produced by former CEO Min Hee-jin, who was involved in a management rights dispute with HYBE last year. NewJeans claims that ADOR terminated their exclusive contract late last year due to this incident and expressed their intention to pursue independent activities. In response, ADOR filed a lawsuit against NewJeans to confirm the validity of the exclusive contract and, earlier this year, submitted a provisional injunction to preserve its agency status and prohibit NewJeans from signing advertising contracts.  

The provisional injunction was resolved in ADOR's favor. In March, the court granted ADOR's request, ruling that NewJeans could not engage in independent activities. Then, in May, the court ruled that NewJeans must compensate ADOR with 1 billion won per member each time they pursue independent activities. NewJeans immediately appealed, but the appeal was dismissed in June.  

Another lawsuit filed by ADOR—to preserve its agency status and prohibit advertising contract signings—could be prolonged. The third hearing for this case is scheduled for the 24th of this month. **Even if a first-instance ruling is issued this year, there is a possibility the case could proceed to the Supreme Court.** ADOR explained, ""We aim to confirm through litigation that the members' unilateral claim of contract termination is unjust,"" but added, ""It may take considerable time before a final ruling is reached.""  

**NewJeans' exclusive contract with ADOR expires in July 2029. If the legal battle over agency status drags on, the contract period could end before the dispute is resolved.**  

The problem is that NewJeans is ADOR's only intellectual property (IP). **The longer NewJeans' hiatus continues, the more ADOR, a subsidiary that has significantly contributed to HYBE's performance, will struggle.** HYBE grew under a ""multi-label"" system that guarantees autonomy in its artists' musical activities. Labels like ADOR are subsidiaries that nurture artists.  

HYBE, as the parent company, plays a supporting role in the business operations of its subsidiaries, including ADOR. **As a result, key agenda items for HYBE's board of directors often involve subsidiary management.** The board, chaired by founder Bang Si-hyuk, consists of nine members. **Last year, the board held 21 meetings, 19 of which included agenda items related to subsidiaries.** These primarily covered matters such as △approval of subsidiary shareholder meeting agendas, △execution or amendment of major subsidiary contracts, △financial loans to subsidiaries, and △establishment of subsidiaries. **This demonstrates how HYBE's board is deeply involved in subsidiary management, as if HYBE and its subsidiaries function as a single entity.** 

Consequently, HYBE's board cannot avoid responsibility for ADOR's business slump due to NewJeans' temporary hiatus. Moreover, ADOR was one of HYBE's most profitable subsidiaries. Last year, HYBE's consolidated revenue reached 2.2556 trillion won, combining the sales of subsidiaries like ADOR, Weverse Company (fan platform), Big Hit Music (BTS), Pledis (SEVENTEEN), and Belift Lab (ENHYPEN & ILLIT). ADOR's 2024 revenue, generated solely from NewJeans' IP, was 111.2 billion won—similar to Belift Lab's 151.5 billion won, which manages multiple artist IPs.  

**Considering that other major subsidiaries responsible for HYBE's future business, such as HYBE America, are operating at a loss, ADOR's value becomes even more significant. Last year, ADOR's net profit was 23.9 billion won, while HYBE America reported a net loss of 140 billion won. Weverse Company and HYBE IM recorded net losses of 10.7 billion won and 27.7 billion won, respectively.**  

However, with NewJeans' hiatus, ADOR's performance may decline. Since the pause, NewJeans has not released new albums, held concerts, or signed new advertising deals. While revenue from existing music, albums, and previously contracted advertisements and photoshoots continues, new income streams have been cut off.  

**The dispute between NewJeans and HYBE could ultimately harm all of HYBE's shareholders. HYBE's stock price began declining when suspicions arose about former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin's alleged attempt to seize management control—the incident that triggered NewJeans' hiatus. By the time NewJeans held a press conference last November to declare their exclusive contract invalid, the stock price had fallen to the mid-100,000 won range, a significant drop from its peak of over 400,000 won post-listing.**

HYBE maintains that the lawsuit against NewJeans was unavoidable but that it is making every effort to resume activities at any time. A HYBE representative emphasized, ""We have consistently provided all necessary personnel and facilities for NewJeans' entertainment activities and will continue to do so.""  

They added, ""ADOR has received proposals for various projects, including advertisements and events, from external parties. Internally, we have already completed plans for this year's activities, including a full album release and fan meetings."" They also stated, ""We have communicated to NewJeans members our desire for sufficient dialogue.""","n4iihhp","thetari","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1753187329,49,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n4iihhp/",2025-07-22 12:28:49,2025,7

"I think they'll keep the label as long as they need to demonstrate there's a label that can uphold its end of the contract with New Jeans. Maybe long enough to win the court case, but at least until the situation gotten irreversible enough that they no longer need to demonstrate they're waiting with open arms for NJs to return.

There's no guessing how long that will take or what it will look like, so I doubt Hybe have made any firm plans about what happens after then. But I doubt they need to keep the label alive to collect damages/penalties or manage other things like New Jeans royalties. Music labels are bought, sold, merged, transferred or shuttered all the time, along with all their contracts and balance sheets and other legal and financial detritus. 

The whole field of Mergers and Acquisitions exists to manage that type of change.

"ADOR further claimed, **""They even waged a public opinion campaign. Lee Sang-woo prepared seven items for the media campaign and reported them to Min Hee-jin. On April 16, Min ordered the campaign's launch, and from April 22 until the contract termination on November 28, they systematically executed this strategy. These seven items were actually presented as reasons for contract termination. This demonstrates Min Hee-jin's involvement behind the scenes. She even directed the members' mothers to participate in the media campaign, which they did. On September 11, the members themselves conducted a live broadcast criticizing ADOR and HYBE - again orchestrated by Min. On October 16, they appeared at the National Assembly to condemn ADOR and HYBE, another move masterminded by Min. From beginning to end, Min Hee-jin was pulling the strings behind this contract termination.""**

ADOR pointed out the fundamental flaw in the defendants' termination claims, stating, ""The essence of this case is shifting all failure risks to the agency while monopolizing the fruits of success. This destroys the very foundation of the K-pop industry.""

The agency then addressed each termination reason NewJeans cited - breakdown of trust, music industry reports, the ILLIT 'ignore' incident, HYBE PR team member's remarks, and allegations of coercion - referencing the provisional injunction ruling's findings.

ADOR emphasized, **""The burden of proof for contract termination lies with the defendants, who have failed to provide any evidence. On the contrary, only the absence of valid termination grounds has been confirmed.** Maintaining the contract allows the defendants to continue top-tier entertainment activities while avoiding penalties and damages. Most importantly, ADOR is still preparing for their comeback, with all staff eagerly awaiting their return. This is why the high court also determined returning to ADOR benefits the defendants. Termination would deal fatal blows to both parties - the plaintiffs would lose their sole artist and revenue source. The K-pop industry would suffer irreparable damage as investors withdraw. Without cultivating new talents, the industry would inevitably collapse. For the defendants' sake, ADOR's survival, and K-pop's future, preserving this contract is essential.

First the plan was revealed as ""Project 1945"" during the ""illegal"" audit. Then Hanni used the workers cause at the National Assembly to share her sob story. Then they used the Jeju air crash all because of ribbons in court. Then they went on a Western media tour, insulting the K-pop industry (which they benefitted out of) and SK just to brand themselves as ""revolutionaries"" during the time where the country was in a political crisis. And finally, the girls are totally fine with comparing their dilemma to that of school bullying and domestic violence. What will they use next?

"It does for sure, but they're hungry for it. I don't think they'd be putting in all the effort if they didn't want to. If it's any consolation though, there is about a 3 week gap between Lolla and their next tour date. Their tour dates for the first half of this tour seem a lot more spread out than Ready to Be was, so i think they're pacing themselves fairly well. 

On the heels of Kpop Demon Hunters release, their comeback, and then Lolla, i think their schedule is very well timed.

ZEROBASEONE Zhang Hao Confirmed to Appear on Netflix Variety Show ‘Getaway and Go with Jangdobari’

ZEROBASEONE’s center Zhang Hao will appear as a guest on the Netflix variety program Get Away and Go with Jangdobari.

According to a report by TenAsia on the 28th, through this program, Zhang Hao will be reuniting with Jang Do-yeon after about 6 months.

YouTube ‘Salon Drip 2’

Back in February, Zhang Hao appeared on the web variety show Salon Drip 2 with the group’s leader Sung Han-bin, showcasing his refreshing charm and drawing significant attention.

At the time, Jang Do-yeon highly praised Zhang Hao, saying he was a “character you’d want on variety shows.” This appearance left a strong impression of Zhang Hao in the variety world, and even during the recent 100th episode of Salon Drip 2, his name was mentioned despite him not appearing, demonstrating his lingering presence.

Because the chemistry between Jang Do-yeon and Zhang Hao especially stood out, many fans had eagerly been waiting for their reunion. This news of his appearance is especially welcome to such fans.

‘Getaway and Go’, Jang Do-yeon’s Special Talk Show

Getaway and Go began airing its first episode on the 28th of last month, and is broadcast every Saturday at 5 PM via YouTube.

TEO

The program is planned as a 20-episode series and, like Salon Drip, is produced by TEO. With a unique concept of “packing up a bundle of stories and going on an outing with Jang Do-yeon,” this content features one guest per three episodes, each episode being about 35 minutes long.

The first guest on the program was actor Byun Yo-han, followed by Wi Ha-jun, who also worked alongside Jang Do-yeon.

Now, with Zhang Hao joining as a new guest, anticipation is rising over what kind of chemistry he will show.

An industry insider stated, “We’re excited to see what new kind of fun will come from Zhang Hao’s unique personality combined with Jang Do-yeon’s signature comfortable and considerate hosting,” and added, “In particular, Zhang Hao is also scheduled to appear on Hyeri’s YouTube show Hyel’s Club. After being highly praised by Jang Do-yeon for his variety sense early this year, he has been receiving continuous love calls from variety shows.”

Zhang Hao Active in Various Fields

Instagram ‘zb1official’

Zhang Hao is currently active as a panelist on MBC’s variety show I’m Sunny Thank You, showing off his impressive wit.

In addition, he is set to take on his first acting challenge in the upcoming drama Let’s Go to the Moon later this year. After debuting through Mnet’s Boys Planet and standing out on terrestrial TV, he is now also making his way onto the global OTT platform Netflix.

As the first foreign-born idol to win in the history of Korean idol survival audition programs, Zhang Hao continues to break new records day by day.","n5q54y0","zhaoberry","t3_1mbzx6m","t3_1mbzx6m",1753756768,3,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1mbzx6m/zerobaseone_zhang_hao_to_guest_on_jang_doyeons/n5q54y0/",2025-07-29 02:39:28,2025,7

"2nd reply to copy a translation of some paragraphs from the article, really interesting stuff and confirms that they act upon evidence:

  
*""The targets of the investigation are: nine companies that manipulated stock prices through false disclosures; eight companies related to “corporate hunters” who took over listed companies and siphoned off assets; and 10 companies related to controlling shareholders who utilized inside information to gain private benefits. Of these, 24 are listed on KOSDAQ or KOSPI, and five are mid-sized companies with annual sales of more than 150 billion won.*

*""According to the National Tax Service, the amount of tax evaded from these companies is about 1 trillion won, which may increase as the investigation continues.*

"Sorry i meant to get back to you much sooner but i unexpectedly ended up having to be like 5 people at work today.

I've been a fan for ages now and he is my favorite member so you learn much over time. Key is a certified yapper (even recently has his own yapping show) so he has spoken at great length on the matter over the years about his inspirations, he has also spoken about his creative input in other areas, and we know his higher education was related"" graduated from Myongji University with a degree in Film and Musicals, and attended Woosuk University for his postgraduate degree, majoring in Culture and Education Contents Development during which he gave multiple seminars and his thesis was titled ""The Influence of Styling Education on Appearance Satisfaction and Self-Esteem of Korean Adolescents""

Bad Love:

[Allure Interview](https://www.allure.com/story/shinee-key-bad-love-hair-makeup-interview): on the release ""which takes us to the '70s-era retro space world of Key's dreams, complete with '80s rockstar vibes and a hint of '90s kitsch. Key calls it a salad bowl of trends. All play out on his version of old-school Hollywood sets — like the ones Star Trek or 2001: A Space Odyssey would film on, he notes."" David Bowie is a long time inspiration of his and it definitely shines through on this release. Key has always been one to use his hair as a canvas for a release and he states here, ""It's not about what's my favorite hair color. It's just more about the album, the music, and the concept."" He also speaks about how ""As an artist, I'm always imagining and coming up with concepts, so portraying them is not hard."" but that the challenge for him is ""You can't do everything at once, right? I need to be more selective, and that's what I find difficult.""

[Vogue Korea Interview](https://www.soompi.com/article/1490286wpp/shinees-key-talks-about-finding-inspiration-for-upcoming-solo-album-importance-of-living-true-to-himself-and-more): He speaks about how he took a more leading approach in the creative direction of his solo work compared to before, ""For my previous album, I considered the votes of experts in the field and other staff members. However, for ‘BAD LOVE’ since I had already suggested the keyword ‘retro space,’ I wanted to include my own input more than before. My standard for choosing the album design came from the thought that a CD is a type of souvenir. You want to collect it, and you feel good when you get it. Rather than something you could buy at any time, I wanted an album that had a strong, seasonal vibe"" adding, “That’s right. People who buy artbooks might do so because they like it, but they also get great enjoyment just from possessing them. I want my album to be like that.” He also speaks about how he encountered a lot of difficulty and opposition with the release too.

[NME Interview](https://www.nme.com/features/music-interviews/shinees-key-interview-solo-mini-album-bad-love-i-finally-became-me-3055775?utm_source=hootsuite&utm_medium=&utm_term=&utm_content=&utm_campaign=): He again speaks about the difference in level of control he had with his debut album, Face, compared to Bad Love where he said he was finally able to become himself. “[During] my first solo album, ‘Face’, [I was] involved in making choices, but those choices were laid out for me. But this time, from the beginning, I was able to say what I wanted to do, what I wanted to create, and what my vision was.” and that he had actually been building this release for over 14 years in his head. 

[Another Allure Interview](https://www.allure.com/story/key-shinee-essay-a-k-pop-star-turns-30): He says, “It wasn’t until 2015, seven years after my debut, that our staff asked for our opinions. I think that was the epiphany moment, like, ‘Okay, I need to make these decisions’.” He also touches on the well known fandom tidbits llike that the group chose the title track, View, and that he changed the styling from what was originally planned for them to the iconic looks we got instead. He also speaks a lot on his desire for androgynous/genderless style in fashion that he himself has often pursued over the years.

['BAD LOVE' Jacket Photoshoot Behind ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFz8o4um6TA): Not nearly as in depth as later videos but he does talk a bit about his inspirations and such.

Gasoline:

[Billboard Interview](https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/key-gasoline-solo-album-interview-shinee-1235133296/): Some few highlights of a much longer interview where he cites older movies he grew up with (such as Gremlins, Nightmare on Elm Street, Nightmare Before Christmas, Mars Attacks) ""Everything came from ’70s, ’80s or ’90s horror and adventure kinds of movies. I wanted to combine all of that in the album [photoshoot] and that’s how it came out."" ""How to be scary and cute"" coming from the idea of movies he found scary as a kid were more cute to him as an adult. The creation of Boksille, ""What’s that movie? Gremlins, right? Like little goblins from kids’ movies, I’ve always wanted to express those kind of cute, little dolls in my album. I always wanted one of my own."" He wanted to do something ""that’s very much in contrast and very different from Bad Love"" to ""show a more powerful side"". 

When speaking of the title track: ""While we were looking for and discussing songs, there wasn’t one that stood out to me so I spoke with the writers [and producers] Kenzie and Moonshine as well to ask them to write the title track. Everything was in my brain. I explained the instrumental that I wanted, literally, with my mouth [makes beat sounds] and imitated the sounds. I explained all the concepts of the music video. And they made it into “Gasoline.”"" Mentions the concept images came first then the fashion was built for that and what he wanted to show off in the mv saying, ""Specifically talking about this track, it was about figuring out fashion that can go both ways, creating a look that can impact and influence all genders when it came to conceptualization.""

[Clash Music Interview](https://www.clashmusic.com/features/shinees-key-on-his-solo-evolution#.YVKMM70_7Ug.twitter): Speaking on the process mindset he has where, ""Key worked on this release as if it was his last. “It’s not, but that was my mentality. That’s how much I poured my entire energy in this,” he says. “For the title song, it’s really difficult to choose. You know, economy, business, fans,” he scrunches his nose at the struggle. “But if I’m choosing other songs, it’s easy: I like it, or I don’t like it.”"" Also his identity , """"The most important message that I want to showcase in this album is my identity as a singer, as an artist,” he says. “I’ve told the fans and media that this album is truly a reflection of myself, all my preferences and things that I love combined.”""

Good & Great:

[Weverse](https://magazine.weverse.io/article/view/949?lang=en) pulls together a few difference sources: Touches on how Face, Gasoline, and Killer were his ""retro trilogy"" so he wanted to put that aside a bit and tackle something difference even down to the packaging where it is ""for all the albums—BAD LOVE looks like the packaging for a toy, Gasoline an old video tape, Killer a limited-edition game box—plays on variations of the retro theme. Compare this to Good & Great, where KEY opted for an office concept in the packaging, complete with cover letters, reports, and ID cards.""

He always includes an english song in all his Korean releases just for his ifans: Face with Imagine, Bad Love with Helium, Gasoline with Another Life, Good & Great with CoolAs, Pleasure Shop with Novacaine, and we haven't had all the track info released for Hunter but i am sure there will be another english gem in there too especially as he recently spoken about wanting to tour worldwide.

>Red Velvet's #SEULGI and PLAVE’s #EUNHO Feature on New Tracks from #KEY’s Upcoming Album 'HUNTER'

>The track “Perfect Error” (Feat. Seulgi), included in the album, is an R&B pop song that layers retro-style synths over a catchy guitar riff. Its lyrics carry a bold and positive attitude, expressing that even if things go slightly off course, trusting yourself can still lead to a special day. Seulgi’s warm vocals add to the song’s completeness.

>Another new song, “Infatuation” (Feat. EUNHO of PLAVE), is a modern reinterpretation of the 1990s new jack swing genre. With bright, upbeat synth sounds and a laid-back rhythm, it creates a romantic mood. The lyrics emotionally capture the feeling of ""lovesickness"" while reminiscing about a short-lived summer romance, and Eunho’s unique rap feature further enhances the track’s charm.","n64zo3n","SapphireHeaven","t3_1mdxk0p","t3_1mdxk0p",1753956404,21,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1mdxk0p/red_velvets_seulgi_and_plaves_eunho_feature_on/n64zo3n/",2025-07-31 10:06:44,2025,7

"I think it's hard to really say for sure. If you think about it though, the 2 biggest groups internationally, BLACKPINK and BTS, didn't really released anything since like 2022. Those groups did a lot of heavy lifting for the industry on an international level. So missing them is going to be a huge hit, especially if you're basing things off streaming and charting numbers.

"It’s fully an echo chamber on the pro-nj side at this point. They’ve gone beyond pretending to care about facts or sources or official statements. 

You’ll see one of them say “In court Hybe admitted to doctoring the cctv footage” or “The judge confirmed that Hybe were abusing nj” with no source linked or even screenshotted, and absolutely nobody in the replies will be asking for any further information. They literally take whatever their fellow bunnies say at face value and no outside sources or commentary is to be trusted. It’s actually quite culty, in terms of the information control and demonizing of outside source material. Even if someone provides a source that directly contradicts a bunny’s claim, all of their followers will say it isn’t real.

They can’t depend on “Kpop Demon Hunter” hype every semester to sustain their charting, either.

At this point, I’m indifferent, their actions are only harming themselves.

Pragmatically, if they made a comeback now, they’d remain popular and still be a big group.

"Pitching in, I think it’s fine if we don’t see Saja boys again, by their treatment in the show I got that they were meant to be side characters and I’m not super attached to them.

In my opinion, a good villain makes a good story. They are as important as the heroes because without them, there are no heroes. 

I’ve seen disappointed reviews about the ending, it’s not just simping or hype because Jinu was a character featured throughout, of course people want to know what happened to him. The ending was anticlimactic.

In a flashback, Jinu was actually unhappy inside for betraying his family. We can believe the narrative shown to us, or there could be other reasons unknown, using the imagination as you said. 

From memory there was a part where Gwi Ma says to Jinu, “Everything you have was given by me.” Usually in stories where characters make a deal with the devil, it does not go well. 

I think there were mentions that Devil powers can affect personality or something. So maybe that was one of the costs and side effects from making a deal with Gwi Ma, Jinu couldn’t bring his family with him.

Of course the big villain can be Gwi Ma, but he gets so little screen time. The theme was Rumi accepting herself as a half human and demon, one of her parents were literally a demon, so I think it makes little sense to carry a puritanical approach that all demons must be purged.

Sure some demons cannot get redeemed but it’s disappointing that Jinu’s redemption is self sacrifice leading to his erasure. What happened to Golden and the whole Rumi growing patterns and her patterns becoming holographic at the end? 

Maybe I am hoping too much after watching Avatar The Last Airbender, Zuko’s redemption was well done. I was hoping to see Jinu be redeemed in other ways, he had opportunities to betray Gwi Ma.","n6wrmhh","rosafloera","t3_1lvk3gu","t1_n2pdxew",1754330047,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n6wrmhh/",2025-08-04 17:54:07,2025,8

"Imho it’s not the theme of the music, it’s the genre it’s presented as. I think in the West that bright pop style of inspirational music can often be viewed as cheesy or childish for a lot of younger people, especially preteen onwards. Not saying teens/young adults wouldn’t enjoy it, some certainly do, but it wouldn’t really be viewed as “cool”, which is the biggest factor towards becoming trendy. Especially since Kpop is already negatively viewed as childish by many, songs that give off that vibe don’t always attract young adults. Unless kids get into it when they’re young, they probably won’t have a soft spot towards it as they age into teenagers. 

(I will say Kpop Demon Hunters has kind of been an outlier here, but I think it’s bc it was marketed as feel-good/inspirational so people know what they’re getting into.)

ITZY has a lot of great songs that I think would do well in the West if they’d been TTs, JYPE’s timing has just been so off. They teased a mature concept and then released Sneakers, which I love, but I can’t deny that it reminds me a lot of a song from a Disney channel show, and I get why casual ITZY listeners were turned off. (And when I listened to Checkmate I was kind of floored that they passed over 365 or Free Fall as the TT — those are so unique and the standouts for me in that album while Sneakers sounds like a lot of songs I’ve heard before.) Then for Cheshire they decided Boys Like You should get an mv? I like a couple parts of that song but otherwise melodically it’s soooo lazy, almost boring, to me. It gives nursery rhyme in a bad way, and the fact that it’s all in English and was meant to be western promo tells me that JYPE doesn’t know ITZY’s international audience. Someone who’s 12-14 might love those tracks and then keep listening to it when they’re 16-18 bc of the memories they have surrounding it, but they’re not songs that many 16-18 year olds would choose to listen to of their own volition, from what I’ve seen. And those are the ages that really set and define what’s cool/trendy, plus they have more buying power. If they’re not interested then it won’t catch on. 

I think having Sneakers then BLY as promoted tracks made a lot of casual ITZY listeners fall off and I can get why. Especially as someone who got into ITZY bc of In The Morning, I’ve always loved their darker/tougher concepts and I think they pull them off better than their bright ones. Kill My Doubt was also a good album, and Cake (which I love) is a quintessential ITZY track, but the damage by then had been done and everyone was calling it childish and cringy bc of Sneakers & BLY. (I fully disagree but at the same time idk why JYPE gives ITZY killer songs like Kill Shot that could 100% go viral but doesn’t choose them as TTs.) 

People were really mad at the Checkmate concept switch up bc a lot of people who grew up w ITZY were ready to see the group mature alongside them. I don’t think it’d have been as badly received if they’d marketed it honestly, and that has been the biggest catalyst towards ITZY plateauing. Most people really only check out the main tracks so all the hidden gems aren’t seen by casual listeners and ITZY gets panned for having “bad” songs. 

Born To Be was a phenomenal album but it came out too little too late — all the folks that would’ve appreciated it jumped ship a couple comebacks prior. Mr. Vampire is one of ITZY’s best tracks to date and even though the mv was so low budget it could’ve become huge if people still cared for ITZY like they did at debut. Gold was good, Imaginary Friend got some great attention, but again, people have their minds made up about ITZY and don’t want to invest their love into something that might switch up on them. Same with Girls Will Be Girls, it’s not a bad track at all and very ITZY, but Kiss & Tell seemed like the obvious standout in the tracklist. JYPE keeps picking decent TTs for albums and then adds phenomenal b-sides that’re even better but don’t get attention from casual listeners.

Personally, I think JYPE needs to move on from the feel-good pop for ITZY (at least at the level of Sneakers & BLY), but they’re doing good in the East so I can see why they keep it up. However when I see Yeji and Ryujin and Chaeryeong now, esp on stage, I get cool badass vibes from all of them, so the cutesy concepts seem inauthentic now. Even songs like Not Shy and Icy were youthful and bright but still seemed rebellious and cool. I think that edge is what’s always made ITZY stand out and the bubblegum tracks don’t feature that at all. 

Phew this is much longer than I intended it to be but essentially, I don’t think ITZY is ever going to rise in popularity again as a group. They’ve been overshadowed now and JYPE fully messed up their trajectory. It’s a bummer bc they’ve always been one of my fave groups (I’ve seen them in concert twice) but their musical direction has been…not good and not set up for general western success, which seems like something JYPE wants really badly for their girl groups. Until they learn to actually pay attention to what those audiences like, though, I don’t see it happening for ITZY.","n7456b3","PBandJaya","t3_1mi0oep","t1_n73oyq5",1754426881,9,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1mi0oep/vcha_has_been_removed_from_the_jyp_artist_page/n7456b3/",2025-08-05 20:48:01,2025,8

"You are using such faulty logic throughout your comment here? In the future take a step back and double check what you're typing actually makes sense before posting it online, especially when the topic is serious.

>Imagine trying to recover from the trauma but then you get triggered because you keep seeing your bully’s face everywhere.

If a victim has such bad trauma that they can't even handle seeing their bully's face then what's the last thing they'd do? Directly involve themselves in the bully's life for the foreseeable future by making public accusations about them. What you have described is clearly not logical reasoning for why a victim might speak out.

> If you can sympathize with the bully, try to see it from the victims’ perspective too.

Where have I not sympathised with the victims? I've even shared my own experiences with my younger sister being bullied. Just because I don't agree with publicly ruining someone's image/career because of their childhood actions doesn't mean I'm suddenly team bully.

>As the person above said, being a celebrity is a privilege just like a driver’s license. Would you give a driver’s license to a bad driver? You won’t. So why reward and make a celebrity out of a bully?

This is a silly false equivalent. Not having a drivers licence doesn't mean you're going to be ridiculed by society and be booted out of your career. Not to mention that you're comparing a test of skill to... human behaviour? If you want a logical equivalent let's go serious and say a child commits a violent crime. Once they're an adult should they have the chance to put that in the past or should they be punished throughout adulthood for it? I think you know where I stand there.

>Idk why you’re defending so hard on this. Do you stan him or stan an idol accused of being a bully? That seems like a long ass paragraph just to say a bully deserves to be a celebrity too.

This is a personal attack to try and discredit my character/intent so you don't have to beat my argument. Not working. For the record I do not like Geonwoo nor do I stan any other idol who has been accused of bullying to my knowledge. Go wild on my comment history if you please.

What I am actually doing is being rational and offering a logical opinion based on my understanding of the human brains development as well as my knowledge on other sociological factors that affect behaviour.

"Hold up, this is sorta maybe one of the most interesting tracks of 2025, much better than Done from the 2nd half of 2024, and it's legit nearly 3 minutes long. 

The instrumentals/production be quite standard, but oddly enough, I rather like the overall execution of it, as the beat is pretty satisfying with each hit, same with the various layered sound effects throughout the song/music video.

---

And yup, the music video for Sensitive as well, wow, we all in the future now, imagine if SM produces a KPop Demon Hunters type of series (or K/DA, Arcane, Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, and so on) with naevis, OMG, make it happen. I want aespa (and maybe (G)I-DLE for the K/DA tie-in) on the soundtrack ASAP too, it'll be gg no re for sure with fellow gamers and Kpop fans.

The MAVE virtual group is gone now, so naevis is our only hope, lmao.

Reminds me, the A-IDOL (with Dreamnote, ICHILLIN, LIGHTSUM, woo!ah!, Purple Kiss, and CSR) survival show is still kinda missing in action, no release yet IIRC. A-IDOL is basically Gone PD/PD Disappeared (PD가 사라졌다!) Season 2, so that's why it's probably taking a while for them to release (if it will ever release at this point). Since they have to work around the current limitations with procedural generation stuff.

---

Nabi/butterfly/naevis through the looking-glass. Alice and Lewis Carroll, eodiseo? Kwangya?!

That last 3rd of the music video (about 2 minutes and 18 seconds in) is also pretty wild, the belting and soundscape, naevis we love you!

And fam, these flying or airborne humpback/etc. whales are like in a bunch of Kpop music videos and so on these days, rofl, these production companies have cool tags/signatures/motifs/etc.

---

All in all, I'm somewhat pretty excited for the developments of nævis and other similar animation/vocaloid/etc. projects, it's a nice change of pace from everything, brings me back to my Jpop/etc. days.

I wish more people will give naevis a chance since this type of production has a great amount of potential for those of us who like animation/3D virtual worlds/et cetera, though ya it's understandable why others don't want to support it since it clashes with the current idol culture stuff.

---

And in the future hopefully people will be more accepting and freely allow the coexistence of these avatars/etc. since there are lots of possibilities in terms of creative elements that can't be done with live action stuff.

And for me I just want them to combine all of these things together to make the best audio-visual experience possible, it'll be so cool too once holographic augmented reality devices become even more accessible as well, so the relatively opportune timing is being set up now. Should only be a few more years before we all get the chance to delve deeper into these digital/virtual/online/etc. worlds for real (maybe even before the inevitable catastrophic disclosure of reverse-engineered tech/unlimited power generation/simulation/multiverse/et cetera, rofl).

but even if we set that aside and take things at face value, the real question is, why are their parents outsourcing responsibility to strangers on the internet? what’s the endgame here? is it just about offloading some of the financial burden? is it a calculated move to publicly demonstrate that the group still has loyal fans that are willing to go to legal and reputational battles for their idols? it just really begs the question of who stands to benefit from this setup?

if anything, newjeans' parents are weaponizing their daughters’ fanbase and involving them also means throwing them to the wolves by implicating them in this mess. they're also just handing ador and hybe more ammunition. more material, more witnesses, and more leverage to justify or obscure their legally ambiguous actions.","n81xzbp","arreux","t3_1m0bzjz","t1_n81vs9v",1754883675,17,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n81xzbp/",2025-08-11 03:41:15,2025,8

"Just gonna cross post my comment from the SHINee sub (also the whole album is stellar):

UGH I AM SO PROUD TO BE HIS FAN AND AM SO GLAD I AM IN THE SAME TIMELINE AS HIM!

Just so creative and interesting and dedicated ...gritty? Raw? Unafraid to show vulnerable parts of himself and his mental space?

And very committed to the acting involved/believable. I avoided spoilers, so am I correct in assuming black hair was the Hunter and red hair the Hunted? I know he talked about different versions of himself meeting.

Dancers please correct my wording as needed, but what I'm calling the precision and isolations in the choreo were immaculate!

"most soundtracks don’t really make it to traditional radio play though? we don’t talk about bruno crushed the charts and i never heard it on the radio. 

Also what’s your source for sony giving away the rights to it as i can’t find anything like that. maybe for the soundtrack rights but i was talking about the general film. having a huge company (be it netflix, sony, what have you) backing the project is still a lot of backing and organic isn’t really the right word to use when talking about its success. it was animated at sony’s animation studio so this isn’t a small indie studio release. just because they went for the lowest risk highest reward release strategy for the film doesn’t mean it didnt have an incredible amount of support/resources the whole way through. 

i’m not saying any of the songs are bad but to be frank with out, i highly doubt any of the songs from kpop demon hunters would’ve made it that high on the charts without being part of the movies’ soundtrack. and if the movie was received poorly, they wouldn’t have gotten there too. and this could be said about any soundtrack from an animated movie, if let it go was released on its own, it would’ve never charted. it’s not really a fair comparison to compare to a regular music release, the movie is the biggest promo for the soundtrack.","n83gil5","ohpossumpartyy","t3_1mn040l","t1_n836u0d",1754913136,2,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1mn040l/golden_by_huntrx_ejae_audrey_nuna_rei_ami_from/n83gil5/",2025-08-11 11:52:16,2025,8

"You said it had heavy support from the start but now soundtracks don’t make it to traditional radio? Those are opposing what you originally stated and also not entirely true either. Usually key soundtrack songs (like TWICE’s version of Takedown for this) do get pushed when there’s intent behind them. Tate McRae’s track from the F1 soundtrack this year was fully prepared and heavily promoted as the lead from there. Shallow from A Star Is Born was everywhere. Billie Eilish’s What Was I Made For? from Barbie was immediately pushed heavily to radio and everywhere for a good while.

The difference here is that Golden did not receive that kind of treatment from the jump. The marketing push only ramped up after it began charting, which undercuts the claim that there was heavy initial support. That is not the same as saying the song was always backed simply because it was part of a movie. Those are distinct claims.

It also stands in contrast with songs not tied to a soundtrack campaign and just the usual music release with heavy backing. In this case, the example of APT, which did have a major push right from the start. In its first week, APT was blasting on moving LED screens in major cities around the world - I witnessed it myself. There was radio play, targeted promotion, and visible label support. If we are talking about early, aggressive industry involvement, APT checks that box far more than Golden does. Dynamite by BTS was somewhat similar as well with the Samsung tie in. 

Director Maggie Kang [confirmed in an interview](https://www.thepopverse.com/movies-kpop-demon-hunters-sony-pictures-animation-netflix-relationship) (behind a paywall I’m afraid but link here to an abridged version), that Sony passed on the project initially and it was Netflix that stepped in to finance and greenlight it. This article ([also behind a paywall](https://www.thewrap.com/kpop-demon-hunters-sequels-franchise-plans-netflix/)) says Netflix owns the IP. As it stands, anything released after the fact is now being released via Netflix music under exclusive licensing from Republic Records.

Ultimately, there is no tried-and-tested formula for what has happened here because the way the film and its music have broken through is basically unparalleled. The pattern does not match the typical big soundtrack song rollout (now it does but very much in a game of catchup). But it certainly does not fit the profile of a track with, “heavy support from the start.” This was organic momentum that the industry only leaned into after the fact very different from a campaign like APT, Dynamite, or a soundtrack like Barbie, Frozen, or A Star Is Born.","n83mz8e","let-them-89","t3_1mn040l","t1_n83gil5",1754915711,7,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1mn040l/golden_by_huntrx_ejae_audrey_nuna_rei_ami_from/n83mz8e/",2025-08-11 12:35:11,2025,8

"NewJeans's record for most PAKs went down this week. ""Golden"" from Kpop Demon Hunters has surpassed. I swear, this isn't just me hating on NewJeans, this is relevant to this thread!

Because ok. At the end of this, in a year or so, after contract termination has actually be filed and penalties have been negotiated and NewJeans is free to try to sign with another label or to try to find an investors so they can start their own label.... well, you can see that their stock in the industry is already falling. They lost their PAK record. Their brand deals are going to eventually expire. Other active idol groups will get the attention of fans AND the general public. The more time that passes and the less relevant that NewJeans becomes, the worse negotiating position they will be in when it comes time to sign with a new label or find an investor.

And honestly... NewJeans will probably lose in October. If they try to appeal, it will then be another couple of months before the contract validation will be settled. THEN, presumably they will finally file for termination and I'm assuming it'll be maybe a year before THAT gets all the way through the court systems and then they'll be free to sign with someone else or start their own label with an investor willing to take on all their debt. And after THAT it will presumably be a few months before they could be ready to redebut... without any of their old IP or their old group name. That is going to be a major uphill battle for them to reach the kind of success they'd previously had, imo.","n86yxmo","fauxkaren","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1754952577,51,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/n86yxmo/",2025-08-11 22:49:37,2025,8

But that could be something that breaks up the album, so I'll continue thinking about it. I didn't originally like some of the songs on Gasoline and I came around cause I enjoyed the full album so much.

Absolutely adore the run from Glam to Lavender Love. I'm hearing people say Lavender Love is the fan song and isn't it fascinating to think of Key + the fans' relationship being like a Lavender Marriage to him? Like in a way, it IS a super interesting concept, especially if an idol is queer and the fans are functioning a bit like a beard. Anyways, it's a beautiful song and I enjoyed it.

"I hope you’re not giving up on that possibility, or discouraging future writers from exploring it.  
*Star Wars* doesn’t hold the exclusive rights to the “parent–child” reveal — it’s one of the oldest storytelling themes, especially in Asian traditions.

Of course, if it came out of nowhere, I’d agree: simply declaring Gwi-ma as Rumi’s father *just because* wouldn’t work. But intentional or not, I’ve noticed many subtle hints that keep the door open for that possibility:

* **The VA’s history** – He’s no stranger to playing fatherly or mentor figures with complex ties.
* **His tone at the beginning** – The way he talks about the honmoon and fate feels more personal than usual. After 400+ years, why *this* outburst? It sounds tied to something more recent… perhaps even 20 years ago.
* **“You’re weak, pathetic, useless.”** – That line feels like projection. As though he’s recalling his own failure — maybe failing to save someone who once looked past his nature.
* **The throne lyric** – “Given the throne, I didn’t know how to believe. I was the queen that I’m meant to be.” Clearly it’s about her mother and succession from the Sunlight Sisters. But thematically, it could also echo her *father’s* hidden role with a literal throne.
* **“I thought you actually believed you could be free.”** — A deeper root for his bitterness: if Gwi-ma’s cynicism comes not only from centuries as a demon but from a personal failure — perhaps once trying to change and losing everything — then his scoffing at Jinu isn’t simple condescension. It becomes a warning, shaped by experience. A voice from someone who’s been there, who tried and failed.
* **The prodigal moment** — between Gwi-ma and Rumi, as they finally meet one-on-one. It plays out less like a simple confrontation and more like a parent insisting they’re right, trying to prove a point. Rumi doesn’t defy him outright; instead, she acknowledges his words — *“I can’t,” “They do,” “It is”* — but reframes the last truth into hope: *“So we can make a new one.”* It’s a parent–child reckoning, where despair is pressed down, only for the “child” to transform it into possibility.","n95dm27","Auric180","t3_1lvk3gu","t1_n2e64vl",1755421570,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1lvk3gu/ama_with_kpop_demon_hunters_maggie_kang_chris/n95dm27/",2025-08-17 09:06:10,2025,8
"Verivery fans please read this! This is a cry for help!

Spoiler about Boys 2 Planet next:

\>!Dongheon(the leader of Verivery) just got eliminated(only just though), and I’ve heard a lot of Verrer’s discuss not voting for both Kangmin and Gyehyeon to not separate the group. While I somewhat agree, it was the choice of the members to go on the show, and we should support the members in whatever route they choose(by voting for them, or at least not refraining from voting for them solely for the reason of keeping them ‘together‘).!<

\>!Additionally, Kangmin currently ranks at 7th overall, while Gyehyeon remains 40th(out of 48) in the current ranking. If we as stans continue this, Kangmin will definitely have to suffer another loss in the next episode. Kangmin’s debut in this group is all but confirmed, and it would be lonelier and harder for him(as well as the other members of Verivery) if he were to debut alone, instead of with Gyehyeon.!<

\>!While the debut of two members could cause a lull in group activity, it could ultimately bring a lot of positive effects for the entirety of the group, as demonstrated by other situations(prime example being Minhyun). For example, two members of Verivery active in an extremely successful and famous group(to the degree of Zerobaseone) will bring a lot of attention towards the group, likely expanding the fanbase. There is a high chance that this will also lengthen the contract lifespan of the group and prevent disbanding, as the company will definitely see an advantage in keeping the group. This might also increase group activity, resulting in more albums and content to spur the new boys2planet group’s fans attention. Lastly, it will also bring more attention to their potential solo careers, later along the line.!<

\>!Some fans may still feel as if voting for both will be separating them, but I believe that not voting for either of them for that reason is the same as forcefully separating them from both each other, and their hopes and dreams to be in this new boy group. While I cannot force anyone to do anything I urge everyone to vote for them. I know that most other fans will know this, but all three of the members are amazing and showcase their talent and personality perfectly in boys2planet, as they do in any performance \^\^!<

I urge everyone to vote, if not for the members themselves, then for the future of the group.

Thank you so much! Please excuse me for any mistakes I have made because English is just not my first language!

I watched Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts... and loved it so much Ive seen the entire series dozens of times.

I watch Avatar The Last Airbender probably 100 times since it aired on TV. 

Encanto (while not my cup of tea per se) amazed me at how great the animation was, the songs were, and the story was!  Ive seen it at least 10 times.

I watched Kpop Demon Hunters last night.... and... WTF?  This was the most BORING, PREDICTABLE, LAZY and sometimes just APPALING animation I have ever witnessed.  The main characters were so unrelatable, the plot was just abysmal and never even explained how the fucking honmoon works.....  The songs were atrocious!  Like some generic party CD that they sell at Party City or some shit with songs everyone knows but sung by some random fat dude in his basement so they can avoid paying royalties to the actual artists.

I think it would be really fun to explore the other girls aside from Rumi better, and they've created a universe a) where there's lots to delve into and explore and b) that could suit an episodic format really well-- eg. they could do a stand-alone adventure every week where they defeat a different demon or something, that overall leads into an overarching storyline.

For the countdown live, Kendall said she wants the group to perform for the Valorant finals, and this song is kinda along the lines of those Riot Games tracks. And Savanna they need to make a Spanish song too, so I'm excited about that as well.

"it would have been very interesting to see how newjeans would have performed in the us this year in comparison to blackpink and katseye. jump while peaking high and having the most streams overall saw most of that success overseas and wasn’t as popular as bp’s previous songs in the us, while katseye saw a huge boost in popularity from gnarly, gabriela, lollapalooza, and their gap ad going viral. even twice has gotten some attention from kpop demon hunters and lollapalooza as well. 

it’s hard to say what 2025 would’ve looked like for newjeans because they never released their full album but how would they have performed against their biggest competitors in the us? they would’ve already been challenged getting their momentum back after their singles last year underperformed and didn’t even chart on the hot100 but i think this year would’ve been about proving they have longevity in the us even if they weren’t the most successful or talked about out of each of the girl groups mentioned. i wonder how mhj would’ve reacted to actual competition as well. 

but this is why these early are so crucial, blackpink may have underperformed in comparison to pink venom but they’re still established enough that a 6 million stream debut is still big. twice has been a slower burn but the past several years promoting in the us is starting to pay off for them, and then the door’s been left wide open for katseye to go viral left and right and they arguably have the most eyes on them right now. but instead of newjeans being part of this discussion we’ll never know what this year could’ve potentially looked like for them or the next. they never got to establish themselves as a group behind those catchy viral songs on spotify and they’re going on two years of career limbo. just looking at their spotify profile it’s insane that they threw that all away, i just don’t know how they continue in any path forward without feeling some level of regret of just how good of a position they were in","nby1d7k","LittlestDarkAge","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1756779189,48,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/nby1d7k/",2025-09-02 02:13:09,2025,9

"**Fireproof** - I'm literally watching the Tempest/Polaris Kdrama (with Jun Ji-hyun and Kang Dong-won) right now and paused it momentarily for Wendy, and this track legit reminded me of how much I wish Wendy would do more Kdrama/Korean variety shows/etc. soundtracks or theme songs. Cuz this one is so apt for Tempest/Polaris based on the mood/lyrics/et cetera, even more so with the church or Roman Catholic vibes of the Kdrama, sometimes I wish Wendy would do those choir-like songs to demonstrate her vocal range.

**Sunkiss** - It's a good title track, Wendy proves her vocals every time with each song. I still wish she went for a Vermilion (the last track of her 2nd mini album from 2024) type of sound as I love it, but I like this sunshine/solar release too. The music video production was nice as well, especially in the second half when they had more of the varied scenes/sets/etc.

**EXISTENTIAL CRISIS** - I'm always just having an existential crisis as well, lol, especially with the astonishing (the flying orb kept its trajectory after the deflection!) MQ-9 video (from October 30, 2024) released through yesterday's third public hearing about UAP/USO/NHI/etc. stuff (2023-07-26 and 2024-11-13 were the two previous hearings), and I'm still not sure how that video/clip is not mainstream news yet (it's understandable though as it's a fringe/etc. topic), but this song should hopefully help most of us in the coming days and years. Cuz it's a track to definitely rock out to, though maybe for some it's a bit too short at 2 minutes and 23 seconds long.

**Hate²** - Whoa, is this an actual anthem/rock-focused mini album? Interesting, it's more subdued than the other tracks, but still on theme for the driving rock concept.

**Chapter You** - From the very first second with the 3D soundscape effects or vocal layering, I knew this track would be one of my favorites, it's relatively laidback with the instrumentals but listen to her ethereal voice, she's an angel from heaven (it's even mentioned in the lyrics for this song, lol). Holy, I'm definitely using this to test IEMs/headphones/etc. in the future, it's one of those songs where you feel like an immortal Xianxia cultivator ascending to the heavens.

**Believe** - It's the epilogue and prologue at the same time! A powerful vocals performance by Wendy, one of her best, god-tier for sure. The music video/film for this song is just Wendy and the vast open ocean/sky/fields/et cetera, such cool imagery.

---

As expected, this mini album is one of the best vocals exhibition of 2025, she's literally the best, wow. 

Every time I wish she releases at least twice a year or so, or yup, wish she had more regular Kdrama OSTs so that we ReVeluvs can hear more of her studio-level vocals, cuz while I love her more live/raw/etc. vocals in the various shows she partakes in, sometimes the studio magic elevates Wendy's already innate and amazing voice. And as you see with Chapter You and Believe, she's forever incredible, timeless, the exemplar of her generation/Kpop in general.

Here's to hoping fellow fans will continue support her with the new company (ASND, same place as fromis_9!) and so on. Cuz I swear fam, we all need Red Velvet Wendy's vocals, especially in times like these days, she's the wonderful eternal light to everything.","ndf3lnh","MNLYYZYEG","t3_1nd960r","t3_1nd960r",1757497756,18,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1nd960r/red_velvet_wendy_cerulean_verge_the_3rd_mini_album/ndf3lnh/",2025-09-10 09:49:16,2025,9

"I can't believe the members didn't even show up 😭😭😭 I naively had hope that since 2 members went to the 1st mediation, maybe all 5 would go to the 2nd mediation to hear for themselves what ADOR and the judge(s) had to say and demonstrate that they're at least trying to solve their issues with ADOR even if things fall through.....but not showing up at all?!?!? Somehow that wasn't on my bingo card 😭

Contrary to what some people (+bunnies) may believe, I am NOT and I NEVER HAVE been sitting here rooting for the NJs girls to suffer. Quite the opposite, in fact. I WANT these girls to make good decisions. Since the beginning, I have desperately wished for the girls to break free from MHJ's influence and for their parents to actually protect them from future harm. I don't want the girls to tank their careers. I don't want them to be misled by lawyers with a conflict interest due to being MHJ's law firm first. I don't want them to turn down the opportunity to mediate with and maybe even settle with ADOR. I want them to help themselves! And not showing up in person for the 2nd mediation is the opposite of that. I'm so disappointed. :(","ndnjath","justanotherkpoppie","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1757605764,65,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/ndnjath/",2025-09-11 15:49:24,2025,9

"As the person who implied that we ignore all the important stuff that Team Bernies posted, unfortunately deleted their comment, I'm gonna post the intended response as a new comment, because yo 🤷‍♀️

*Start*

I assume you mean the Team Bernies posts.

A) the CLO is indeed there as a witness. The CLO is an experienced lawyer. If the witness does not remember specific details, shouldn't the witness stay to the truth and say they don't remember? If they don't know because they weren't there at that moment, is it not legit to say they don't know? 

Then again, Mhj is on record herself stating she didn't know Davolink and we KNOW that that was not true, so I do understand the hesitance of not believing an ""I don't know""

B) If somebody asks me if I reviewed THOUSANDS of messages, and I have, I'd also say ""yes, there are things I remember and things I don't"" and then it is upon the other party to provide the missing details IF they are indeed changing anything.

C) claiming somebody cherry-picks messages to then cherry-pick messages is a known legal strategy. Sejong did literally the same in the NJ trial by presenting Hanni's messages in a redacted form while the unredacted fo showed a different situation, but there Tokkis are suddenly surprisingly not interested in context or full meaning 🥹. So why did Sejong not at any point early present all messages if it is blatantly obvious that the VP is the mastermind and MHJ is the poor manipulated CEO uwu

D) a CLO indeed is not responsible for media monitoring or media interaction or anything like that. Which is pretty known in...dunno...corporate.

E) regarding the IPO sidetrack there: I had headhunters tell me ""IF an IPO happens"" which is a common thing. Additionally, the IPO thing has ironically enough nothing to do with MHJs case because ADOR is not public. And if BSH would have told her an IPO is immanent while possible IPO is still internally evaluated, or if he even said ""we are thinking about an IPO"" without her having signed an NDA or being directly involved in the thinking THAT would be an actual issue. But yo, again... Corporate experience vs MHJ and people who don't understand basic corporate 🥰🤷‍♀️

F) regarding recordings etc: Given that MHJ understands a lot of things the way she wants to understand them, let's wait for that one. She has proven to be an unreliable witness, but again, we are waiting for the next session.

So... What exactly is the big reveal here, the big win for MHJ and Sejong that should make the headlines?","ndyyzlf","HomoCarnula","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1757759287,66,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/ndyyzlf/",2025-09-13 10:28:07,2025,9

"This year has also been a weak year for both K-Pop and Pop, relatively speaking. Spring-Summer last year, in K-Pop we had Aespa's Armageddon and Supernova; NewJeans before the controversy; in pop we had Sabrina Carpenter's Espresso, Please Please Please, and Taste; Chappell Roan's Good Luck Babe!; Billie Eilish's Birds of a Feather;  Kendrick Lamar's Not Like Us; Taylor Swift's TTPD album; Ariana Grande's Eternal Sunshine.

Aespa & Blackpink are doing very well in Korea but they're not doing better or more viral than their previous releases or relative to their current popularity. Aespa had two underwhelming releases this year, at least in the eyes of international fans. Golden has reached more than 1200 PAKs, still ongoing, despite Blackpink, IVE, Aespa, DAY6, Lim Young Woong, and IU's releases. If anything, winter-spring releases have been stronger with Like Jennie, Allday Project's releases, IVE's Rebel Heart, and G-Dragon's releases.

Alex Warren & Morgan Wallen have been dominating Billboard for weeks prior to KPop Demon Hunters, and they're mostly carried by exorbitantly high radio play. Anticipated releases from Sabrina Carpenter for example weren't very well received and underperformed, Justin Bieber's surprise release did okay for 1 week but people seem to have already forgotten about it right now. There are some newcomers doing well like sombr and Katseye but they're not at the top of the top yet. Many 2024 songs are still charting really high.","nea80zw","GaurdsGuards","t3_1ngzp9o","t1_ne8jdbj",1757904863,18,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ngzp9o/kpop_demon_hunters_soundtrack_from_the_netflix/nea80zw/",2025-09-15 02:54:23,2025,9

"Ya, there are so many stories they can tell in the past.  The first hunters creating the honmoon and the last gen's final battle where her mom fell in love with a demon and later died being the most obvious.

The only sequel material I can think of is that her plan for Jinu worked with other demons who got trapped on this side before the new honmoon was built.  They don't hear the voices anymore and are trying to be human again.  Can the hunters trust them and help them re-integrate, and can they stop the faction that desperately want to get back to the demon realm?  And Jinu will be back somehow, re-materialized from his soul or something but only the demons can fix him.","nencczm","xipheon","t3_1nj14pp","t1_nen0ivq",1758081495,13,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1nj14pp/a_new_kpop_demon_hunters_short_film_has_been/nencczm/",2025-09-17 03:58:15,2025,9

"As someone who was and is still a big fan of both LSF and NewJeans (yes, it's possible, there are many), it was wild to see how LSF was universally hated for a whole year on online English speaking K-pop communities, until the MHJ saga happened, and then all of a sudden, fearnots are invited to all the cookouts and tokkis are shunned, and then people are going to pretend the k-pop world wasn't pretty heavily anti-LSF when ""Easy"" came out?

Regardless, when you look at the charts and groups like NewJeans, BlackPink, and Aespa are still doing pretty dang well and people love listening to them, you realize chronically online people don't dictate actual taste. I remember when the Demon Hunters movie came out and they asked all the people who worked on it who their faves were, a lot of them were happy to admit NewJeans, BlackPink, etc.","ng0862h","mittenciel","t3_1npfllc","t1_nfzz4sf",1758743855,3,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1npfllc/aespa_rich_man_english_version_the_jennifer/ng0862h/",2025-09-24 19:57:35,2025,9

"Hopefully so, the President was already willing to invest in Korean Entertainment and Culture in the future with the results of their soft power (Kpop) being used by others without actually owning it themselves. This was already highlighted by HYBE about Kpop Demon Hunters. 

The thing about this tampering being prominent NOW, rather than before is simply because Producers/Artists/Creative Directors have access to Global Investments. But of course, Kpop is still highly considered niche that it wasn't accounted for up until now, and only rely on old laws much like how ADOR/HYBE approach their case with NewJeans.

"A Twitter user, ""Adorsupporters"", has released a petition calling for reconciliation between HYBE and ADOR. You can access the whole petition through the [Google Doc form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeRitBkBkq2w2cWkiNwf9qOaXTfB8uwZXKbV0WppWDCOxGyng/viewform). This is the following content:

**Proposal for Reconciliation and Compromise for ADOR's Peace and New Future** 

Amid the ongoing conflict between HYBE and former ADOR CEO Min Hee-jin, with no signs of resolution in sight, we cannot stand idly by. Both parties have maintained sincere engagement thus far, and it is difficult to definitively conclude that either side has provided grounds for a loss of trust. Therefore, those who wish for peace and reconciliation at ADOR issue this statement containing a compromise proposal.

*1. Actions Both Parties Must Take*

Both sides must agree on the overarching principle of ‘reconciliation and compromise’ and resolve misunderstandings and distrust through direct dialogue, not just statements to the media. They must publicly acknowledge and apologize for the disappointments caused to each other to restore trust. To prevent the conflict from escalating publicly, they should issue a joint statement or hold a press conference to convey a message of harmony and mutual prosperity. Furthermore, they must withdraw all civil and criminal lawsuits, complaints, and accusations, cease mutual criticism through both official and unofficial channels, and commit to preventing recurrence.

*2. Contract Resolution*

HYBE must reinstate former CEO Min Hee-jin to her position as ADOR CEO and explicitly codify a prevention clause in the shareholders' agreement to ensure no future attempts are made to indirectly remove the CEO through directors appointed by them. Furthermore, as a proactive measure for her return and cooperation, former CEO Min Hee-jin should demonstrate the virtue of compromise by waiving her right to claim the put option payment. Furthermore, NewJeans should return to ADOR. Considering the hiatus period, their exclusive contracts should be renegotiated to account for an extended contract duration.

*3. Arbitration Committee*

To ensure the effective implementation of the agreed terms, an arbitration committee should be established to periodically evaluate compliance. The committee composition should be: 7 members from HYBE (3 internal, 2 ADOR directors elected by HYBE, 2 external), 7 members from former CEO Min Hee-jin's side (2 internal, 1 artist representative, 2 pro-Min Hee-jin artist fandom representatives, 2 external), and 5 neutral members (1 non-Min Hee-jin artist fandom, 3 jointly nominated external members, 1 pro-active/pro-Min Hee-jin artist supporting fandom).

We sincerely hope this proposal will end the current unfortunate situation and serve as a turning point for HYBE, Min Hee-jin, and NewJeans to walk a path of mutual growth rather than mutual destruction. Thank you.","ngz1yy4","LLBird811","t3_1m0bzjz","t3_1m0bzjz",1759220470,26,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/ngz1yy4/",2025-09-30 08:21:10,2025,9

"Unfortunately that's usually how it goes. Hence the need for an ""outside perspective"", even if you feel solid in your decision. The problem is, MHJ kept NJ and their families close to her chest. Remember when she pretty much ordered the parents NOT to meet with HYBE reps (per the testimony of the witness I believe, where he said they were hesitant to meet HYBE reps bc they thought they were demons/monster, but met them against MHJ's wishes and was surprised by how nice and normal they were).","nho6eso","Embarrassed-Play-438","t3_1m0bzjz","t1_nhnyfxs",1759554895,44,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/nho6eso/",2025-10-04 05:14:55,2025,10

"**[EJAE's letter via Instagram:](https://www.instagram.com/p/DPad8h1Dmzo/)**

>The past few months have been a crazy ride… I mean I was just on SNL!!! I’m so humbled and grateful for the love I’ve received as a songwriter and the singing voice of Rumi from KPop Demon Hunters. Getting so much exposure so quickly has been strange, exciting, and truthfully a little scary. People keep referring to me as an “artist” or a “star” - which is everything 11 year old EJAE dreamed of, but over the years, I became comfortable behind the scenes and I didn’t think I was meant to be an artist.
>
>Recently though, I realized I don’t need to box myself into being the traditional view of an artist. To me, an artist is someone who uses their art to express themselves, and songwriting is my art. For years, writing has been my therapy, my way of coping, celebrating, making sense of the noise in my head. Along the way, I wrote some songs that never found the right home. I’ve decided I want my artist project to give life to those songs, so people can laugh, dance, or cry with me and the amazing collaborators who helped create them.
>
>There’s one song that feels like the perfect place to start. Writing this song helped me through a hard time, and I hope that sharing it can help others too.
>
>It’s called “In Another World” and is releasing on 10/24/25.
>
>Thank you to everyone who has supported me so far. I know my journey is still being written, and I am so grateful to anyone who is willing to tune in.

"Hello! I wanna start by saying that I really love Kpop Demon Hunters! Everything is so well made, and congratulations to everyone involved in making a beautiful masterpiece! If you ever read this, I only have two questions and a fun fact for you all! 

  
1. Does anyone from the cast know about the Polytrix ship and considered addressing it in the sequel? Because it's my FAVOURITE SHIP!

2. If/When the trilogy is complete (because I have every faith that it is inevitable), would you consider collabing with PSY to do a new version of Gangnam Style if possible? I believe that a HUNTR/X and PSY collab of Gangnam Style would ABSOLUTELY blow it out of the water! EVERYONE would love it! I know I would!

There've been a lot of comparisons between Rumi and Elsa from Frozen since both of them have long braids and have to learn to accept mystical connections which they were conditioned to fear (Rumi's demon patterns, Elsa's ice patterns).

"Hi Arden and May!

I loved the movie and your characters! I can't stop singing Golden and trying to hit the high notes 😂

**For Arden:**

1. Since you were originally asked to sing the demos, I wanted to ask how much your voice as well as your versions of the songs influenced the final versions?

2. I heard your demo of Your Idol and I wanted to know if you participated in the songwriting and deciding what songs made it into the final product?

3. I just wanted to say I love how hauntingly beautiful your vocals for Hunter's Mantra were. Was this done  intentionally or did it just come out that way?

**To May:**

1. I would love to know how you felt being asked to sing for Mira?

2.  Do you feel that the writers of KPDH modelled some of Mira's personality after your own?","nicxikz","PurpleDemon24","t3_1o0j9r1","t3_1o0j9r1",1759891314,2,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o0j9r1/hey_rkpop_were_arden_cho_rumi_and_may_hong_mira/nicxikz/",2025-10-08 02:41:54,2025,10

Both of you curated such excellent performances as the film provided, and I am so impressed by how dynamic the characters’ voices were; how the first two acts of the film gnawed at the lighthearted and genuinely hilarious, and the dark and dismal of the moments leading to What It Sounds Like. What was it like getting in the roles of these two characters during your voice acting sessions, and what tips would you give to fully express the emotional range of a character?

We listen to it all the time because it cheers us up while doing exercise at the gym. We live in spain, and  I was surprised that many people know the song and the movie, and thats so cool! Many people got into KPOP thanks to KPOP DEMON HUNTERS, and attracting so many people to a new genre of music and being known worldwide for that is great and Im really proud of you guys for doing that. My bias in HUNTR/X is Rumi and I love her braid. I started trying to sing the song like you guys since it came out and I did it kind of good sometimes. How can you sing that high note so good?

"I’m just curious about this part of the movie, idk if you guys can disclose it but there was this moment before the final scene of Huntrix facing the Saja Boys where Rumi was talking to her adoptive Mom (forgot her name) when the Honmoon was severely damaged and demons are out and about at that point, anyway there was this one point where Rumi says something like “I’ll be the one to destroy it.” due to the events that lead up to this point in the movie, concert sabotaged, revelation that Rumi has patterns both to Mira and Zoey, and that made her run off which lead to Rumi’s line mentioned above being stated and then she disappeared there, then literally the next scene was Rumi marching back to the stadium to face off the Saja Boys along with Gwi ma and the rest is history. This scene in particular didn’t flow well with me, I like the movie but that sequence was kinda awkward and stood out for me in terms of fluidity.

Question is, between that scene where Rumi was having a conversation with her Mom and that final scene of her marching back to face the Saja Boys, was there a deleted scene that showed Rumi having a moment of clarity before facing the Saja Boys?

Note: Idk if I’m dumb or just missed the context of Rumi’s final line before disappearing into the air after dropping said ominous sounding line.","nifdeom","FaFaKembot","t3_1o0j9r1","t3_1o0j9r1",1759933457,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o0j9r1/hey_rkpop_were_arden_cho_rumi_and_may_hong_mira/nifdeom/",2025-10-08 14:24:17,2025,10

"Okay, so I honestly don't know how to formulate this, so it is at least slightly legible and understandable because I'm so exhilarated to have a chance to have some of my questions answered 🥹🥺😭❤️❤️‍🔥

First and foremost, though, I have to extend my deepest gratitude and congratulations to you on the massive success of the film ☺️ This film has been my, I don't want to say obsession, but at least deep fixation and dare I say craving for the past 3 to 4 months. I feel like it definitely healed something deep inside. So I'm endlessly grateful that it exists and that you are part of it. I don't want to trauma dump on you guys, but yeah, just know it and you did heal part of me.

I'm just going to rapid-fire list some questions that are probably easy to answer, these are for both of you:

1. What was your favourite scene in the film, both to watch and to voice act?
2. Favourite song?
3. What was your favourite outfit?
4. Who is your Saja Boys bias?
5. What is your favourite food? Korean or otherwise?
6. Do you have a favourite Korean word/phrase? If so, what is it?

The next few will be some more in-depth ones:

7. How do you think the girls will break the news (e.g. demons, them being demon hunters, Rumi being half demon) to Bobby?
8. What are stories not yet explored in the film that you would like to see next?
9. What do you think happened to Rumi's mom and for that matter to the third Sunlight Sister?
10. What are your opinions on Celine? Both as a person, a mentor to Huntr/x and as a mother figure to Rumi?
11. What do you think the girls' net worth is? Individually and as a group?
12. Do you think humans not trained as hunters able to see Rumi's patterns?

These might be somewhat triggering so feel free to skip them if you'd rather not answer them:

13. How do you think Mira and Zoey will react when Rumi tells them what she asked Celine to do?
14. Do you think Rumi asked Celine to kill her out of a genuine desire or just desperation born out of the situation during and after the Idol Awards? 
15. What would you like to see explored in regards to trauma, emotional and mental health issues? If anything?

That was all for now and thank you so much for answering (any of) them in advance if you end up doing so 😭❤️

"omg, as a Big Mira Fan, I am so excited (rumi is cool too) I ran into this post!

May Hong, two questions!

1. what would you like to see in the sequel be explored when it comes to Mira?
2. Do you think Mira should end up with Abby (assuming he's alive), an entirely new character, or maybe no one?
3. Do you have any headcanon details about Mira that wasn't exactly confirmed in the movie? it doesn't have to be plot related or important, maybe like her favorite kind of drink and such.

Arden Cho for you my questions are:

1. Do you think Jinu and Rumi are meant to be or was it a tragedy from the start?
2. While we know nothing about Rumi's dad, what do you imagine Rumi's demon dad to be and how would Rumi react to him should they meet?
3. Do you have any headcanon details about Rumi that wasn't exactly confirmed in the movie? it doesn't have to be plot related or important, maybe like her favorite kind of drink and such.","nigazp8","DomzSageon","t3_1o0j9r1","t3_1o0j9r1",1759943327,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o0j9r1/hey_rkpop_were_arden_cho_rumi_and_may_hong_mira/nigazp8/",2025-10-08 17:08:47,2025,10

"babymon's comeback was disappointing, such a basic typical sound for kpop, almost sounded like hard attempt to sound like huntrix from kpop demon hunters or a music track for a video game but without an actual catchy beat that'll stick in your head. it's so obvious that they poured tons of money into their mv but does it matter if the actual song isn't catchy. drip was catchy (thank u GD) although still not my music taste, sheesh was okay with a cringe ending but at least had a mid-catchy part, and forever in my opinion was their best track that really sounded like how they should sound. it's so obvious that their music production is subpar. also the fact that like 95% of the lyrics is english is disappointing, because an important part of kpop is obviously the korean lyrics even though some of it can be in english. in my opinion psycho or supa dupa love could've been better as a title, but again both those songs have really abrupt changes to the rap parts that sound off and not smooth with the rest of the song, and one of them had another chanting cringe ending too. honestly i don't think babymon is for me and won't be following them for awhile unless they come up with something better/trendy/catchy, but i assume with the current production they probably won't,. more looking forward to nextmonster, i have better hopes for them for some reason but if they get the same producers as babymon i'm not sure if they'll do well other. other than that blackpink's comeback in november might excite me.","nisyd5g","OkDeparture3550","t3_1o2qv9h","t3_1o2qv9h",1760116243,-2,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o2qv9h/babymonster_we_go_up/nisyd5g/",2025-10-10 17:10:43,2025,10

"**Blue Valentine** - The music video is more laidback and low budget than I expected, like the realism/etc. might be part of the direction of the video. They had so much aegyo and sagwa in the countdown live video about an hour ago, so I kinda got the vibe.

**SPINNIN' ON IT** - This is akin to High Horse wherein I get why people love it, but I wish I liked it more.

**Phoenix** - Whoa, I love this way better than the title tracks/prereleases. The howling/etc. in the background, XG x NMIXX collaboration when?! Something about this song makes it an instant NMIXX classic, seriously, we all gotta relish the vocals and instrumentals combo for this, it's amazing.

**Reality Hurts** - Story of my life, lol, the bass on this from the onset hits real deep, like reality, wow. You definitely need a dedicated/standalone subwoofer to fully enjoy this track as that bass is absolutely relentless. New planet means inevitable UAP/USO/NHI/etc. disclosure, let's go, reversed-engineered tech gonna save everyone (hopefully), we gotta all negotiate with the universal consciousness/simulation/overlords/etc. to manifest it all, ahlie.

**RICO** - Tropical blue bird time (RIO), somebody add this for Tropico 7 next year, lol, I like it.

**Game Face** - The vocals layering from the very first second, I already knew I'd adore this track. My God, around 50 seconds in, the soundscape integration with their vocals reverberating in the background, holy, god-tier NMIXX release, I found it again, PAPILLON successor! This is the one for those of us with kilobuck IEMs/et cetera, what an experience.

**PODIUM** - Pandemonium? On top of the world. The driving beat for this is so good, it's like a throwback too. The ending is for xianxia immortal cultivation ascension, the layers and tiers!

**Crush On You** - Wait fam, is this NMIXX album supposed to be like a partly Latin-esque/etc. one cuz I'm eagerly awaiting their next all-Spanish release like the Spanish version of Sonar. I actually like this song, it's more minimalist but has that bright atmosphere.

**ADORE U** - Time to rock it out for this wonderful NMIXX anthem, they executed this well, beautiful vocals with the instrumentals. Hold up, it's shorter than anticipated, wish it were a bit longer, I legit like this more than a considerable portion of NMIXX's title tracks, it's a nice change of pace.

**Shape of Love** - Another classic type of sound, I love it, so happy NMIXX can do songs like this as not a lot of groups can successfully accomplish such tracks, it's a wild thing.

**O.O Part 1 (Baila)** - Fam, not gonna lie, I was expecting Jinni's vocals when I first heard this track a while back, I miss her so much, wish Jinni was more active as a soloist or at least had her first comeback. Lily's background vocals on this song in general are forever legendary.

**O.O Part 2 (Superhero)** - The instrumentals or overall soundscape for this version is for fellow band/etc. fans, it's delightful, I like it much more than the original track from 3 years and 7 months ago (February 22, 2022, time flies). Pleasant closer to the album.

---

As one of the biggest NMIXX fans in the world (since JYPn days!), I think this 1st full album is good, but I wish they could've went a different route for it, like I was hoping for a Papillon-esque release (so many layers with the instrumentals and vocals with this song, it's why I love it despite its relative simplicity) as it's probably my favorite NMIXX track of all time. Like Papillon is still my personal best song of 2025 so far, though again, I can see that track not being as good for others who prefer less maximalist/soundscape-heavy/etc. sounds or say if they want less repetitive lyrics and such things.

So for me I still prefer Fe3O4: Break (BOOM, Passionfruit, XOXO) and Fe3O4: Forward (Know About Me, Papillon, Ocean) over this Blue Valentine full album, but I appreciated this release as well, one of the best ones of 2025 for sure.

For a long time now I have had NMIXX as literally my actual true ult group (my other main one, Red Velvet, as a complete group had no schedules for 2025 (maybe even 2026 too, that said, I enjoyed the solos/subunit releases of 2025 though), so I'm looking forward for their next release as I know it'll be another great hit.

Overall I think we fellow NSWERs had a magnificent year, like more people discovered NMIXX's talents, and hopefully their songs will resonate with them even more now, super excited for their future!","nj8x7hf","MNLYYZYEG","t3_1o5em0m","t3_1o5em0m",1760349602,6,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o5em0m/nmixx_blue_valentine_1st_full_album/nj8x7hf/",2025-10-13 10:00:02,2025,10

I mean, you don't have to agree they're all that similar, but it's disingenuous to not see why they're one of the groups most commonly mentioned when people ask for something similar to K/DA or Huntr/x. Not to mention people who've worked on KDH themselves have also confirmed BP served as one of their musical inspirations, this being one of the most overt mentions:

For Huntrix, EJAE reveals the music was inspired by several K-pop artists, particularly BLACKPINK and (“a little bit of”) aespa. It made sense as BLACKPINK has worked closely with the team at THEBLACKLABEL since their debut. EJAE herself has written several songs for aespa, creating this cinematic sound for their music.

"Nah, I didn't base it on the commonality of them being girl crush. After all, several songs from both K/DA and Huntr/x don't evoke the YG or BP sound - they don't negate the handful of songs that do.

They're still overall musically distinct from YG groups and the other groups they drew inspiration from, but that's the point. Artists draw specific elements from others and build off of them. They don't have to be 1 to 1 copies to be able to acknowledge where they *are* similar. I'd actually say the association is more tenuous in K/DA's case, but KDH's executive music producer has flat-out confirmed that How It's Done uses the ""signature TBL drop"" often heard in BP songs. So again, I think it's disingenuous to completely divorce Huntr/x from YG music (I take it we understand it's rather synonymous with TBL music in this case) when the KDH producers have spoken to the opposite.

>[How would you describe the sound THEBLACKLABEL brought to the soundtrack? When I listened to “How It’s Done” for the first time, I could immediately hear Teddy Park in the production.](https://www.billboard.com/culture/tv-film/kpop-demon-hunters-music-producer-interview-1236025034/)

>It’s totally a THEBLACKLABEL drop, right? It has the hard-hitting beat. It has this incredible synth lead line. We wanted to have a drop like that for “How It’s Done.” THEBLACKLABEL has that all over their work — it’s in BLACKPINK and other songs all the time. We wanted to make sure HUNTR/X had that, so we created space. That might not happen in a normal narrative song, where all they say \[on the chorus\] is “how it’s done, done, done.” But that’s a THEBLACKLABEL signature. There are definitely BLACKPINK vibes in the score, though I also feel like they did their own thing for us.

I do agree with your last sentence and that We Go Up isn't the classic YG sound, and that it even sounds like something Huntr/x would release. But I find it ironic as well as a stretch to say that YG is hopping on the KDH, or I suppose specifically Huntr/x, trend when Huntr/x itself drew from the YG sound, and as such it's not surprising that BM and Huntr/x are up the same alleys.","njupazb","jollypog","t3_1o2qv9h","t1_njrqlnw",1760644679,1,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o2qv9h/babymonster_we_go_up/njupazb/",2025-10-16 19:57:59,2025,10

Yseult deleted post where she initially called out Soyeon and then redirected her frustrations at everyone involved in the video. I think she got caught up in the moment of seeing her video and got mad at the wrong person, but she corrected herself. It's interesting how quick people are at demonizing Yseult. It's also interesting how Yseult was being harassed for days before the story caught the attention of more people (mainly black folks) on Twitter who began to give Soyeon fans the same energy back — which isn't something I condone, but let's not act as if this was an equal battle from the start.","njzyd2a","nagidrac","t3_1o900wt","t1_njyu2um",1760719274,22,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1o900wt/rtee_issues_statement_over_damdadi_mv_plagiarism/njzyd2a/",2025-10-17 16:41:14,2025,10

"**Argument:** NJ were treated unfairly compared to other idol groups under HYBE/ADOR and suffered discrimination/unfair treatment (including auditing of Min Heejin, corporate structure issues, etc).

 \- Court found that NJ’s treatment was not shown to be unlawful or to have breached an important obligation under the contract.

 \- Court emphasized that subjective feelings of unfairness or disappointment do not constitute the objective collapse of the contractual trust relationship.

**Argument:** By NJ seeking independent entertainment / advertising activities (outside ADOR) or by ADOR restricting them, their freedom of occupation and freedom of artistic creation have been infringed.

 \- Court held that the exclusive contract allows NJ to perform and create under the typical agency arrangement and that compliance with the contract does not necessarily infringe artistic freedom.

 \- Until the main lawsuit on contract validity is resolved, the order recognizing ADOR as the exclusive agency and restricting independent activity does not violate these freedoms.

**Argument:** ADOR’s actions (or inactions) in protecting NJ from leaks, imitation, brand dilution, or other operational harms demonstrate ADOR failed in its duty, giving NJ grounds to terminate the contract.

 \- Court assessed that ADOR has continuously engaged in planning activities (fan meeting, future releases) and attempted communication with NJ (which NJ allegedly refused) and therefore did not abandon their obligations.

 \- The court found that NJ’s claims of harm were self-inflicted (e.g., choosing to act independently) and did not provide sufficient evidence of ADOR’s major contractual breach.

**Argument:** NJ’s assertion that the agency structure (HYBE oversight, share transfers, change in corporate influence) means ADOR is not the same entity NJ signed with, undermining the basis of the contract.

 \- Court held that even with structural changes (investment, ownership, management), ADOR remained the contractual agency and continued to function in that capacity.

 \- The court did not accept that NJ had proved the agency had become so different that the contract was voidable.","nl0a9af","AnyIncident9852","t3_1m0bzjz","t1_nl0a7xq",1761246487,79,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1m0bzjz/megathread_23_hybe_ador_hybe_rejection_of/nl0a9af/",2025-10-23 19:08:07,2025,10

fans are somehow always expected to read between the lines. to me it demonstrates hubris - like they think they can just do the bare minimum and still sell records. groups from their era work hard to maintain their existing (and bigger) fanbases with open communication and updates - in the meantime, they carry out activities as if CBX were never in the group, and laugh at fans' comments about 9 members.","nlmyy1r","ieatbe","t3_1oh66z7","t1_nlmv16p",1761567881,24,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1oh66z7/exo_to_release_their_8th_studio_album_in_the/nlmyy1r/",2025-10-27 12:24:41,2025,10

"contract challenges of this magnitude require leverage — whether in the form of overwhelming public support, independent operational infrastructure, or undeniable legal precedent — none of which were firmly established here. the entertainment market historically favors the rights-holding corporation, as demonstrated by cases like fifty fifty and cbx, where attempts to exit or renegotiate early resulted in stalled careers, reputational damage, and ultimately limited strategic gains. 

while it is clear there was a legal plan in place, strategy is not judged by its existence but by its alignment with power dynamics, contract law enforcement patterns, and institutional incentives. and realistically, legal firms also operate with their own interests in mind: high-profile cases generate attention, precedent arguments, billable hours, and reputation value, regardless of outcome.

whether or not counsel believed in the long-term viability of the case, it is evident the structural environment did not support a favorable resolution for the artists. this is less about fault and more about the immutable calculus of leverage within a vertically integrated entertainment system.","nm4omb6","supergradeconscious2","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_nm4natg",1761793646,6,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nm4omb6/",2025-10-30 03:07:26,2025,10

"EJAE, the voice and the writing talent behind “Golden,” has gone platinum.

The night before our interview, the 33-year-old singer-songwriter found out that record sales from the [KPop Demon Hunters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPop_Demon_Hunters) soundtrack had surged past a million units. Jimmy Fallon, of all people, [delivered the news](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8y-ViyUk7Dk) alongside a glimmering framed record when she was appearing on The Tonight Show with Audrey Nuna and Rei Ami for the first full live performance of “Golden.” Together the trio make up the singing voices of girl group Huntr/x in Netflix’s animated musical turned bona fide phenomenon. If you have a kid, you probably don’t need a refresher, but the movie follows Huntr/x’s Rumi, Mira, and Zoey as they juggle being astronomically famous while moonlighting as demon hunters (EJAE sings as the purple-haired Rumi). Their singing voices double as their weapons, shielding their fans from the soul-sucking minions of underworld ruler Gwi-Ma.

That Fallon appearance, and the [Saturday Night Live appearance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW9QJIT_T-A) that predated it, might have been the first times that American audiences actually saw (and heard) the human being behind that inescapable song. The adventure fantasy—the directorial debut of Korean-Canadian filmmaker Maggie Kang, who codirected it with Chris Appelhans—is Netflix’s most popular film of all time, with over 400 million views. When Netflix released a sing-along version in theaters, it brought in nearly $20 million, dominating the box office. The soundtrack is one of the highest charting of the year, with more than 7 billion streams. “Golden,” which EJAE partially came up with on a cab ride to the dentist, was number 1 on Billboard’s Hot 100 for eight weeks (as of this writing, it’s only bested by Taylor Swift but remains in the top 10). The promotional tour for the film, which debuted in June, seems to have never ended.

Five-foot-nine and wearing heels, EJAE towers over me when we meet at Netflix’s Manhattan offices. She’s wearing her hair in three braids, reminiscent of Rumi’s iconic hairstyle. Despite looking every bit the part of a K-pop star, EJAE doesn’t consider herself famous. Nor does she particularly want to be, which is somewhat unexpected, considering she was a trainee at famed K-pop label SM Entertainment for more than a decade.

Not unlike American boy-band-forming talent machines of the ’90s, K-pop trainee programs start teaching future stars as children. Trainees keep intense schedules, where they sing, dance, rap, and manage their physical appearances and personas in the hopes of debuting into a K-pop group and becoming an idol. For EJAE, that moment never came. She was passed over time and time again until she was dropped by the label at 23, which she describes as “grandma age for the K-pop industry.” Her voice and her personality, she felt, were better suited for the behind-the-scenes role of songwriting. A decade on, she’s been thrust into the limelight in perhaps the most meta way imaginable—as the voice of a K-pop star that people can’t seem to get enough of. (She has also just released a single of her own music.) She tells WIRED how she’s navigating her newfound success, what it’s like being in the grueling K-pop machine, and the key to writing an absolute banger.

"People have repeatedly underestimated Hybe and their lawyers who have demonstrated over and over again they are 10 moves ahead of MHJ and her team in this 4D chess match.

I remember when many objected to Hybe being ""soft"" on the girls by extending an olive branch to MHJ and offering her a position as producer and inside director. Many viewed it as a sign of weakness but in fact it was a strategic move, probably scripted by their attorneys and pr reps.

And we see now how that move bore fruit when the court used it as a reason to shred NJs ""broken trust"" argument.  Here's what the court said:

>The court stated, **""The exclusive contract in this case does not explicitly state that a specific person, Min Hee-jin, must necessarily perform management duties as the CEO.""**

>It continued, **""ADOR had proposed a contract to re-delegate producing work to Min Hee-jin,""** and revealed, **""However, Min Hee-jin refused that proposal.""**

>The court explained, **""ADOR pursued the reappointment of Min Hee-jin as an internal director even afterwards. However, Min Hee-jin voluntarily resigned,""** and stated, \*\*""It is difficult to view ADOR as having unilaterally destroyed the trust relationship.""\*

Ador's response to the win and saying they want to work with NJs is just more of the same.","nm7y5nc","Night_Owl255","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1761843015,78,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nm7y5nc/",2025-10-30 16:50:15,2025,10

"There's an exclusive news by The Korea Herald. The article is both in English and Hangul so I will just copy and paste the article here in case anyone doesn't want to open the link.

[**[Exclusive] Ador completes track demos for NewJeans’ new album, submits list to court as evidence**](https://n.news.naver.com/article/044/0000276174?sid=104)

> Girl group’s signature production team BANA appears not to have taken part in demos

**Ador, the music label under Hybe and home to NewJeans, has completed several demos for the group’s next album and submitted the list of tracks to the Seoul Central District Court as evidence of its continued management responsibilities,** The Korea Herald has learned.

According to a legal source, **Ador submitted the list to the court in July. The list is believed to contain more than five demos, as it pertains to a full-length album.**

During a trial session that month, **the presiding judges asked whether the list included new songs, to which Ador’s legal representatives confirmed that it did.** The submission was intended to demonstrate that the label has been fulfilling its duties as NewJeans’ management company amid the ongoing legal dispute with the group.

**The tracks Ador in the list submitted to the court are in MR form, meaning the instrumental tracks have been completed, but no member vocals have been recorded.**

In a press statement released Thursday, Ador said, “As we have stated during the trial, we have completed preparations for NewJeans’ official album release and are waiting to resume their activities.”

**Although the kind of music Ador has produced for the group remains unknown, The Korea Herald confirmed that Beasts And Natives Alike (BANA)** — the creative collective behind NewJeans’ previous hit songs such as “Attention,” “Hype Boy,” “OMG” and “Ditto” — **appears not to have participated in the new material.** BANA, founded by Kim Ki-hyun, a longtime friend of former Ador CEO Min Hee-jin, was rumored to be attempting to bring NewJeans under its management in February, when the group announced its departure from Ador, though that speculation later proved false.

The conflict between NewJeans and Ador began in November 2024, when the group unilaterally announced the termination of its exclusive contract, citing a management and production vacuum following Min’s dismissal as Ador’s CEO in August that year. NewJeans argued that their contract was built on trust in Min and that her removal constituted a serious breach of Ador’s contractual obligations.

However, the Seoul court ruled Thursday that NewJeans must maintain their exclusive contract with Ador, stating that Min’s dismissal alone did not justify contract termination. The court said it found no managerial vacuum that prevented Ador from carrying out its duties, adding that “the members’ trust in Min Hee-jin alone cannot be considered a fundamental contractual obligation.”

Following the ruling, NewJeans announced through their legal representative, law firm Sejong, that they respect the court’s decision but plan to immediately appeal, saying, “The relationship of trust with Ador has been completely destroyed,” making it “impossible to return and continue normal activities under the company.”","nmc213j","thetari","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1761897209,67,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nmc213j/",2025-10-31 07:53:29,2025,10

Naturally, the investors, Min Hee-jin, and NewJeans would all become billionaires (It's highly likely NewJeans would receive shares when being recruited).

Order


1. It is confirmed that each exclusive contract concluded between the Plaintiff and the Defendants on April 21, 2022, is valid.
2. The costs of the litigation shall be borne by the Defendants.

Reasoning


1. Basic Facts


(a) The Plaintiff, an affiliate of HYBE Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “HYBE”), is a company engaged in music and record production as well as celebrity management services. The Defendants are popular culture artists who have performed as members of the female idol group “New Jeans” in the entertainment industry.


(b) From around 2018 to 2021, the Defendants were trainees belonging to SOURCE MUSIC Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “SOURCE MUSIC”). After the Plaintiff’s establishment on November 2, 2021, the Defendants continued their preparations for debut as trainees under the Plaintiff. On April 21, 2022, each Defendant entered into an exclusive management contract with the Plaintiff, under which the Plaintiff would have exclusive management rights regarding their entertainment activities (hereinafter collectively referred to as “the Exclusive Contracts in Question”). The relevant portions of these contracts are as follows:


(contract terms omitted for brevity)


(c) On November 12, 2021, the Plaintiff entered into a Business Unit (BU) service delegation agreement with HYBE (hereinafter referred to as “the BU Agreement in Question”), under which HYBE provided certain operational support services to the Plaintiff.


(d) On July 22, 2022, the Defendants debuted as the female idol group “New Jeans” and released their first album on August 1, 2022. The album sold 262,815 copies on the day of release, setting a record for the highest first-day sales of any debut album by a female idol group. Their second album, released in 2023, entered the Billboard 200 chart at number one, demonstrating outstanding commercial success.


(e) In April 2024, the Plaintiff and HYBE conducted an audit of Min Hee Jin. Subsequently, on August 27, 2024, the Plaintiff dismissed Min Hee Jin from the position of Representative Director and appointed B as the new Representative Director on the same day. Min Hee Jin later resigned from the position of internal director on November 20, 2024.


(f) On November 13, 2024, the Defendants sent a certified mail to the Plaintiff listing several issues for correction, including:


1. The phrase “We can just discard X and start anew” contained in HYBE’s Music Industry Report dated May 10, 2023;
2. A statement directed at Defendant AI [HANNI] by a manager affiliated with an HYBE subsidiary saying “ignore her”;
3. Disparaging comments made by an HYBE PR representative about New Jeans’s achievements;
4. Leakage of photos and videos from the Defendants’ trainee period;
5. The devaluation of New Jeans’s achievements due to HYBE’s album “bulk-buying” practices;
6. Disputes between ADOR and Director Shin Woo Seok of DOLPHINER FILMS Co., Ltd.;
7. Attempts by BELIFT Co., Ltd. (another HYBE affiliate) to undermine New Jeans’s originality through the debut of the girl group “ILLIT”; and
8. Rumors of Min Hee Jin’s reinstatement as Representative Director.


The Defendants demanded rectification of these issues within 14 days under Article 15(1) of the Exclusive Contracts, warning that failure to do so would result in termination. The Plaintiff received the notice on November 14, 2024.


(g) On November 28, 2024, before the expiration of the 14-day period, the Plaintiff sent a certified mail and an email containing an official response and an investigative report addressing the issues raised. Nevertheless, at 8:30 p.m. on the same day, the Defendants held a press conference announcing the termination of the Exclusive Contracts, asserting that “the Plaintiff and HYBE have shown no intent to improve or protect New Jeans.” They also sent an email at 12:01 a.m. on November 29, 2024, formally notifying the Plaintiff of termination.


(h) On December 3, 2024, the Plaintiff filed this lawsuit seeking confirmation of the validity of the Exclusive Contracts. On January 6, 2025, the Plaintiff also applied for a provisional injunction prohibiting the Defendants from engaging in entertainment activities without prior approval from the Plaintiff until the first-instance judgment was rendered. The Seoul Central District Court granted the injunction on March 21, 2025 (Case No. 2025Kahap20037), and subsequent objections and appeals filed by the Defendants were dismissed.","nmwg850","Pablo_39","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1762186741,28,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nmwg850/",2025-11-03 16:19:01,2025,11
"2. Summary of the Parties’ Claims


(A) Plaintiff [ADOR]
The Defendants’ notice of termination of the Exclusive Contracts is void. Therefore, the Plaintiff still holds the position of management agency under the contracts. However, as the Defendants are denying the Plaintiff’s managerial status, the Plaintiff seeks confirmation that the Exclusive Contracts executed on April 21, 2022, remain valid.


(B) Defendants [New Jeans]
The Plaintiff gravely breached its contractual obligations, thereby destroying the relationship of trust between the parties. The Defendants, therefore, lawfully terminated the Exclusive Contracts, which no longer hold any legal effect. The grounds for termination are as follows:


(B.1) Serious Breaches of Contractual Obligations


The Plaintiff violated Articles 1, 2, and 5 of the Exclusive Contracts by dismissing Min Hee Jin from the position of Representative Director, thereby preventing Min Hee Jin from continuing his producer duties for the Defendants.
The Plaintiff also failed to take action against acts of infringement and interference by HYBE, BELIFT, and SOURCE MUSIC, violating Articles 1, 2, 5(1)(3), 5(4), and 11 of the Exclusive Contracts, as follows:


1. Photos and videos from the Defendants’ trainee days were leaked via HYBE or its affiliate SOURCE MUSIC to the media outlet Dispatch, yet the Plaintiff took no effective measures.
2. HYBE’s PR manager, AL—who served in a support role for the Plaintiff—made disparaging remarks about New Jeans’s success, and the Plaintiff failed to act.
3. HYBE and its affiliate BELIFT debuted the female idol group “ILLIT,” which allegedly imitated New Jeans’s concept, thereby damaging New Jeans’s distinct identity, yet the Plaintiff remained inactive.
4. Defendant AI [HANNI] was told by an ILLIT manager, “ignore her and pretend not to see her,” but the Plaintiff failed to protect AI from such treatment.
5. The Plaintiff instigated a dispute with DOLPHINER FILMS Co., Ltd.—a key production partner—leading to the deletion of New Jeans’s creative works and rendering future collaboration impossible.
6. HYBE’s so-called “album over-shipment” practices led to the undervaluation of New Jeans’s achievements, and the Plaintiff neglected to respond.
7. HYBE’s 2023 Music Industry Report included the phrase “discard X and start anew,” yet the Plaintiff took no corrective measures.


(B.2) Breakdown of the Relationship of Trust


The Plaintiff’s above breaches, combined with the obstructive acts of HYBE (such as hindering collaboration and luxury brand ambassador offers for New Jeans) and the Plaintiff’s hostile attitude following termination, demonstrate that the trust between the Plaintiff and Defendants has irreparably collapsed. Accordingly, the Exclusive Contracts are no longer effective.




3. Court’s Judgment


(a) Whether the Contracts Were Rightfully Terminated Due to Breach


Upon examination of the evidence, it is difficult to acknowledge that the Plaintiff violated significant obligations under the Exclusive Contracts. Therefore, the Defendants’ assertion that the termination was based on such breaches lacks merit.


---


1) Alleged Serious Breach through Min Hee Jin’s Dismissal


While Min Hee Jin, as the Plaintiff’s former Representative Director, acted as producer for New Jeans and earned the Defendants’ trust, the evidence does not support the conclusion that his dismissal created a managerial void or rendered the Plaintiff incapable of fulfilling its obligations.


The Court finds as follows:


• The Exclusive Contracts do not stipulate that Min Hee Jin must personally manage or produce the Defendants.
• There is no provision granting the Defendants a right to terminate should Min Hee Jin be dismissed.
• Therefore, the mere fact that the Defendants trusted Min Hee Jin personally does not make his position an essential contractual element.


Although the Defendants argued that the contract was formed based on trust in a particular individual (“key man” clause by implication), the evidence is insufficient to establish such intent.


Furthermore, despite Min Hee Jin’s dismissal, the Plaintiff’s operations—comprising about 40 employees solely dedicated to New Jeans—continued smoothly, providing exclusive services such as a fan communication platform, high-end accommodations, and dedicated training facilities. Given New Jeans’s strong debut success, it cannot be concluded that Min Hee Jin’s removal amounted to a fundamental contractual breach.


---


2) Continuation of Producer Work


After his dismissal, Min Hee Jin remained an internal director and was offered a new delegation contract to continue producing New Jeans’s music with the same compensation. The Plaintiff even proposed extending this delegation until the expiration of the Exclusive Contracts (July 31, 2029). However, Min Hee Jin refused these offers and later voluntarily resigned as internal director.


The Plaintiff, therefore, demonstrated sufficient willingness to ensure the continuation of Min Hee Jin’s production role, and the failure to reach agreement resulted from Min Hee Jin’s choice, not from the Plaintiff’s neglect.


---


3) Plaintiff’s Ability to Perform Management Services


Although several months passed before a replacement producer was appointed, the Plaintiff continued to prepare album releases, organize fan meetings, plan a world tour, and arrange performance and advertising opportunities for New Jeans. Accordingly, it cannot be concluded that the Plaintiff was incapable of fulfilling its managerial duties.


---


4) Circumstances Surrounding Min Hee Jin’s Audit and Dismissal


The Defendants alleged that Min Hee Jin was dismissed in retaliation for challenging HYBE’s alleged misconduct. However, the record indicates that Min Hee Jin had been secretly planning to separate the Plaintiff and New Jeans from HYBE, orchestrating media campaigns, regulatory complaints, and potential litigation to facilitate independence. His removal stemmed from these subversive acts, not from any retaliation. The audit conducted by HYBE was thus not unjustified.


(Here the judgment details Min Hee Jin’s private communications and plans to “liberate” the company from HYBE, encourage the Defendants’ parents to raise public complaints, and even file reports with the Fair Trade Commission — none of which were shown to be for the Defendants’ protection.)","nmwgcob","Pablo_39","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_nmwg850",1762186779,34,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nmwgcob/",2025-11-03 16:19:39,2025,11
"(h) She continued:


> “These are all tactical moves. We’re not actually seeking correction from HYBE.
Understand?
Fixing HYBE isn’t the real goal — that’s secondary.
Our goal is an external announcement.
The FTC won’t stay silent once the whistleblowing becomes public.”


AP responded with caution, noting that such complaints might create risks.
Min Hee Jin replied:


> “The real risk isn’t being stuck in the audit committee; the risk is losing the pretext for a public announcement.
Our aims are:


1. Restore our reputation — break the public perception that ILLIT was allowed to copy us;
2. As a result, lower HYBE and ILLIT’s public image;
3. Draw a clear line between our company and HYBE — expose at least some of HYBE’s wrongdoing.
Once that’s public, HYBE will consider selling the company, and we can explore options faster.
If we don’t go public, we’ll end up as the ones being sold, not the ones leading.”


---


(i) Finally, Min Hee Jin warned AP regarding meetings with potential investors:


> “Be careful what you say when you meet that investor.
We must not look like we’re stirring things up because we plan to leave.
If the dispute grows, investors will come to us.”


This was in response to AP’s earlier message (March 19, 2024):


> “I talked with a contact about potential investors capable of trillion-won funding.
He said financial investors (FIs) are easier to work with than strategic ones (SIs), since SIs interfere for their own business benefit.
FIs just want returns.
The ideal plan is to secure FI backing, grow independently from the parent company, then go public or exit.
The key is having the determination not to be taken over.”


AQ replied:


> “Exactly. That’s the mindset we need.”


---


(j) In later conversations, Min Hee Jin told AP:


> “Forget the FTC obsession. What matters is finding legal grounds — unfair interference, breach of duty, whatever works.
Gather as much evidence as you can. The more, the better.
Check old Slack channels — they can’t have deleted everything.”


---


Court’s Interpretation


The Court held that these communications demonstrated Min Hee Jin’s intent to separate the Plaintiff and New Jeans from HYBE, manipulate public opinion, and prepare legal and regulatory attacks — not to protect the Defendants’ rights or resolve contractual issues.
Therefore, the audit and subsequent dismissal of Min Hee Jin were justified and did not constitute a breach by the Plaintiff.


---


(k) Additional Communications and Evidence Cited by the Court


After the April 20 exchanges, the judgment records that Min Hee Jin, AP, and other executives continued discussing how to create public pressure and gather material for lawsuits.
The court presented these additional quotes:


(1) Min Hee Jin instructed AP:
> “Find more decisive evidence. The more, the better.
You’ve already found some on Slack—look for more from BD, AX, AY, or ILLIT.
They can’t have deleted everything from the past.”


The court interpreted this to mean that Min Hee Jin was searching for information that could portray HYBE as engaging in unlawful conduct, with the goal of separating the Plaintiff from HYBE and gaining control of New Jeans’s management, rather than to protect the Defendants.


---


(2) The judgment further quotes Min Hee Jin telling AR and AP that she would not personally appear in the early stages of the dispute, but would instead allow “the mothers” to appear as the ones complaining, in order to make it seem natural:


> “I won’t be the one out front. It’s more convincing if the mothers do it themselves.
It looks organic that way.”


The court found this to be part of a coordinated plan to manipulate public perception.


---


(3) The judgment cites another exchange in which Min Hee Jin discussed with AP the timing of public disclosure of their complaints:


> “We’ll send the official complaint first and wait for their reply.
If they don’t respond by the 11th, we make it public then — the timing will align perfectly.”


---


(l) Court’s Evaluation of Min Hee Jin’s Actions


The judgment then summarizes its findings as follows:


> “From the aforementioned conversations and actions, it is evident that Min Hee Jun intended to separate the Plaintiff company and the group New Jeans from HYBE’s corporate control.
Min Hee Jin planned media offensives, legal complaints, and regulatory filings not to protect the Defendants’ artistic or contractual interests, but to generate negative public opinion against HYBE and create leverage for independence or sale.
Consequently, the audit and dismissal of Min Hee Jin conducted by the Plaintiff and HYBE cannot be deemed retaliatory or unjust.
Therefore, the Defendants’ argument that the audit of Min Hee Jin was an act of reprisal lacks credibility.”


---


(m) Court’s Commentary on Evidence


The court added:


> “It is clear from the tone and content of AQ’s communications that the alleged issues — such as plagiarism by ILLIT or unfair album distribution — were used strategically to attack HYBE.
The focus of Min Hee Jin’s plan was not the rectification of those problems, but rather to publicize them in a way that would tarnish HYBE’s reputation and justify separating the Plaintiff’s business.
There is no mention in the messages of any genuine effort to protect the Defendants or their artistic activities.”


---


(n) Conclusion of This Section


Given the totality of the evidence, the court concludes that the problems the Defendants now raise — such as HYBE’s alleged unfair treatment, ILLIT’s concept duplication, or HYBE’s internal practices — originated from Min Hee Jin’s preparatory efforts to find grounds for conflict with HYBE.
These were not independent contractual breaches by the Plaintiff.
Therefore, the audit, removal, and subsequent actions of the Plaintiff cannot be regarded as breaches of duty under the Exclusive Contracts","nmxy15y","Pablo_39","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_nmxxw9v",1762202289,84,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nmxy15y/",2025-11-03 20:38:09,2025,11
"Honestly I think she did it less as a ""spin"" but moreso to actually spit at JK. They despise BSH to their core. He is the boogeyman MHJ whispered to them and their parents about (remember when the parents met the HYBE reps and expressed their surprise that they were just humans and not the monsters they assumed they would be?).

If they see BSH as the demon, they must have come to see BTS as the devil's sons. The amount of resentment and jealousy has surely spilled over to BTS members, especially as they continue to clearly be close to BSH. 

Remember their plan was to scorch earth. At this point in time they gave NO fcks about publicly mocking even BTS. They really have visions of grandeur about themselves, fed by MHJ and bunnies, that they were destined to be the ""new guard"" to rival BTS.","nn1nrbz","Embarrassed-Play-438","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_nn0nkri",1762260353,52,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nn1nrbz/",2025-11-04 12:45:53,2025,11

"Looking at NJ appeal. Throw back to MHJ response to HYBE's termination of Shareholder contract; Aug '24. [article](https://en.sportschosun.com/celebrity/2024/08/official-min-hee-jin-no-right-to-terminate-14486)

Through Sejong representative, MHJ protested that HYBE is not allowed to do unilateral termination.

>***The contract cannot be unilaterally terminated by either party unless the parties agree or the other party violates the contract.*** *Only when the other party violates the contract do you have the right to terminate it, and if you express your intention to terminate it to the other party, the contract is terminated. (Civil Act Articles 543, 544) And even if you terminate the contract, you can claim the profits you could have gained from the contract as compensation for damages. (Article 551 of the Civil Code):- Sejong representative*

They muddy their statement with the claim that the preliminary injunction cleared MHJ, but that was nothing to do with the Shareholder termination, that was regarding CEO position.

Sejong insists that unilateral termination can only occur if they can prove violation of the contract through legal process.

>*Min Hee-jin’s attorneys have declared that HYBE bears “the full burden of proof” in demonstrating the lawful termination of their shareholder agreement worth an estimated $70.5 million.* [Source](https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/min-hee-jins-legal-team-hybe-must-prove-legality-of-shareholder-agreement-termination-in-70-5m-k-pop-dispute/)

HYBE had already filed for confirmation of termination of contract though.

>*Hive also filed a 'Confirmation of Termination of Shareholder Agreement' with the court last July, with former CEO Min as the defendant. Normally, the effect of termination of a contract occurs when the notice of termination reaches the other party. The other party who received the notice can file a 'Suspension of the Effect of Contract Termination Notice' injunction to assert the unfairness of the termination.* [*Source*](https://en.topdaily.kr/articles/2382)

Although later, MHJ in Nov '24 claimed that HYBE contract termination isn't valid and she is allowed to execute her put options, she never actual filed the injunction to suspend the effect of contract termination notice n Jul. Instead she filed to validate her put options.

TLDR: According to MHJ and Sejong A, no party can carry out a unilateral termination without legally confirming that a breach has occured. Do you hear that NJ and Sejong B, you should have listened to your mother. 😛","nn2w4wx","East_Eye_5582","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1762274390,76,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nn2w4wx/",2025-11-04 16:39:50,2025,11

"But ""Golden"" isn't ""fully in English."" It has Korean lyrics. There's enough Korean in ""Golden,"" ""Soda Pop,"" ""Your Idol,"" ""Takedown,"" and ""How It's Done"" to make them feel quite a bit like K-pop to me. Certainly English speakers singing these songs have had to learn a bit of Korean to sing them, or end up doing the ""beating you is in my blood byeosoobaadadaaa....... beating you is what I do do do"" thing that many a K-pop fan can fully identify with.

Are Huntrix and Saja Boys mostly English? Sure, but so were some NewJeans songs, as in ""ASAP"" has much less Korean than ""Golden,"" but I don't recall that being a problem for K-Pop fans, even in Korea. Even songs that are fully in English can be K-Pop anyway, as long as there's enough Korean flavor to it, and when Korean speakers speak or sing in English, even the fluent ones often have a slight Korean flavor about them. It's hard to detect for some, but as a naturalized Korean-American, I have a tendency to zero in on it, which is why before I saw any credits for K-Pop Demon Hunters, I knew it was full of people like me. I don't think we need to sit here questioning if K-Pop Demon Hunters isn't Korean enough to count. It absolutely is. Koreans are quite proud of it.

As for the Grammy thing, I know some people want to see the cynicism in everything, but I am a first generation Korean-American, and I only see extreme forward progress here. For one very basic thing, this is actually the first year where we have K-Pop songs nominated that actually feature the Korean language. Plus, I genuinely feel like there's a greater than a coin flip's chance of one of these songs (probably ""Golden"") winning.

Moreover, like, what other K-Pop songs are supposed to have been nominated? I feel like these two are the ones that moved the needle globally (and also in Korea). While I realize ""Like Jennie,"" ""Don't Say You Love Me,"" or ""Mona Lisa"" did great numbers on streaming platforms, did lots of people organically listen to them outside of the K-Pop bubble? I have yet to be convinced that it wasn't just blinks and armys hitting repeat. Whereas ""APT,"" I heard my roommate's in-laws jamming out to it, and they definitely don't know a thing about K-Pop. The song was really that big.

As for Katseye, I don't think Katseye being nominated counts for K-Pop, but it doesn't necessarily have to be completely unrecognized by K-pop fans, either. The issue for me is that if we're all being honest, it's hard to be excited for ""Gabriela"" when we really know that the true song of the year for them is ""Gnarly.""","nnqw27t","mittenciel","t3_1oqwpkg","t1_nnn1emj",1762598173,3,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1oqwpkg/2026_grammy_award_nominations/nnqw27t/",2025-11-08 10:36:13,2025,11

"I think more than mistreatment, what ppl think is that they cannot do this that easily bc ADOR went to a whole lawsuit stateting until the end that they want to work with the members again, so if they are willing to go back (even if good intentions are out of the window), and Ador says No, without at least some favorable negotiation towards them. Then, MDH (or even H&H) might have some legal requirement to actually sue ADOR in some kind of  ""false promises"" type of lawsuit.

Optically, it will also look badly them not accepting them back. There is a lot of critic towards NJs rn specially MDH. But a lot of those ppl are not put of the believe that ADOR were saints, but out of NJS own actions in this saga, which demonstrated behaviors more towards entitlement than mistreatment. But those ppl might actually change their opinion and view ador not acepting them back as a ""of course you can never trust companies, maybe they weren't wrong for wanting to leave after all"" without much thought, and bunnis will surely be manipulating ppl to think like that without acknowledging why they dont want them back.

"I don't understand why these three think they have that much bargaining control here. Yes, ADOR has spent the last year trying to retain and support the group (even despite some of the members' best efforts otherwise) but ADOR has also never demonstrated they were going to be *pushovers* about it. 

I've never had any sort of vindictive ""punish them for their hubris"" feelings, but I would at least hope they would have learned something. The timing and tone of these three's statement does not come across as having learned much of anything. At the very least, it's certainly not a professional response.

"ADOR's been playing the long game so far and I firmly believe that they will attempt to do everything by the book when dealing with NJ going forward. The amount of scrutiny on them at this time is immense. It doesn't matter what they do, there will be people out to criticise it, especially Tokkis. That plus the earning potential of NJ.

MHD have already shown themselves to be unreliable, so they'd really need to demonstrate humility if they want to return. And I want to believe that ADOR will keep receipts when dealing with them further. If MHD continue causing drama even after returning, they very well would be sued properly for breach of contract.

"Some people are trying to push the narrative that Reddit is the only place that people are posting negative comments and that this echo-chamber.

Not even slightly true. As a random example, this YouTube video ([뉴진스 1심 판결문 오체분시, 이변은 없었다..!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdYVwZJlwCU)) is from a Korean attorney named 안세훈 (Ahn Se-hoon). His commentary as a criminal lawyer are pretty much what you'd expect, but I think looking at the comment section is more enlightening. There are hundreds of comments that are pretty similar to what's being said here.

A sampling of opinions shared:

* They must have Chinese backing
* The only irreplaceable artist is on the level of Michael Jackson, which these girls are not
* Parental geed is the real problem
* I work for LG, the president just changed so it's time to sue
* I wanted to see the revolution they once yelled so loudly about... but what is this? The parents and the girls are so shameless. They did it for money
* Sick of seeing them, I've never felt this way about an idol before
* I used to be a fan, but they insulted Korea and K-pop on the BBC in front of the whole world
* NewJeans fans are their own anti-fans
* (Verbatim translation using Copilot) ""Thinking back to Ms. Min’s press conference last year, it’s honestly baffling. People who’ve had a proper education fell for those absurd rumors like a swarm of mice enchanted by a flute—becoming fans, demonizing HYBE… It turned into some kind of Danworld cult, with claims that Le Sserafim are pro-Japanese collaborators. Just throw in whatever sticks, huh? 😂 They should be ashamed of themselves.""

On and on like this for hundreds of comments.

Meanwhile, way down at the bottom, as you'd expect, there are a handful of comments like this:

* I knew NewJeans would lose when BSH hired Kim & Chang, they are evil and run the judiciary.... blah blah blah, BSH is jealous of NewJeans success, blah blah blah
* Everyone who stabbed MHJ in the back will face divine punishment
* BSH started all this to distract from Le Sserafim's poor performance in America 
* You're a Yoon supporter, aren't you?

The ratio of comments on that video from people on each side of the issue is broadly comparable to what we see here on Reddit.","nopmxiw","daltorak","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1763073341,82,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nopmxiw/",2025-11-13 22:35:41,2025,11

[**[Official] NewJeans Fandom Bunnies “Support Full Group Comeback…Concern About ADOR’s Impure Intentions”]**](https://m.entertain.naver.com/home/article/144/0001080056)

As NewJeans declared their return to ADOR, the group's fandom has issued an official statement.

The official NewJeans fandom Bunnies stated on the 14th, **""Recently, some entertainment media outlets have published malicious reports related to the members' return to their agency, distorting fans' reactions or opinions, or aiming at driving a wedge between some members. We have gathered the opinions of fans and are issuing this public statement of support.""**

They continued, **""The majority of NewJeans fans respect and support this decision made by all five NewJeans members. Just as the members have gone through a difficult/painful process, the fans will also unite more strongly to cheer for and support all members of NewJeans,""** and revealed, **""We cheer for and await NewJeans members' healthy return with good music and performances.""****

Bunnies also specifically voiced criticism towards ADOR in the statement. They claimed, ""ADOR is currently only issuing statements about regarding some members and asking to 'refrain from speculation about the members,' yet they are allowing the spread of groundless news articles stating that 'ADOR may not accept some members', unchecked**"" and added, **""We hope the fans' concerns that ADOR may have impure intentions are unfounded.""**

Previously, on the 12th, NewJeans expressed their intention to return to their agency ADOR, a year after unilaterally declaring the termination of their exclusive contract in November last year. However, unlike the return of Hyein and Haein, which was announced directly by ADOR, Minji, Hanni, and Danielle conveyed their intention to return through individual statements. Subsequently, ADOR's statement that it was ""in the process of verifying the sincerity of the three members' intention to return"" sparked continued controversy.

**The following is the full text of the Bunnies statement.**

We respect and support the decisions of Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haein, and Hyein, and we cheer for and anticipate NewJeans'full group comeback.

All NewJeans members, Minji,Hanni, Danielle, Haein, and Hyein, decided to return to their agency ADOR on the 12th, and as the appeal period for the validity confirmation lawsuit of the exclusive contract filed by ADOR passed as of midnight yesterday, the first trial ruling has been finalized. NewJeans fans fully respect and support the decision of Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haein, and Hyein, who must have made a difficult decision after careful consideration, and we cheer on and look forward to the comeback of the complete five-member NewJeans.

The past year has not been an easy time for the involved parties as well as the fans,but we do not believe this process was meaningless. We hope this process serves as an opportunity to redefine the relationship between entertainment agencies and their artists enabling greater protection and respect for the artists. We hope ADOR's CEO Lee Do-Kyung keeps the promise she made before the judge. We hope she keeps the promise to faithfully manage the members as their agency and to demonstrate her producing capabilities.

The K-pop or entertainment industry cannot exist without the trust of fans. However, ADOR has only issued a statement about some members and asking to ""refrain from speculation about the members,"" while allowing some entertainment media outlets, which have been biased towards Hybe and hostile towards the members, to publish groundless rumor articles stating that 'ADOR may not accept some members.' We hope the fans' concerns that the agency ADOR may have impure intentions are unfounded.

Since all members and ADOR have decided to move forward together, NewJeans fans will cheer for and await the full group comeback of NewJeans. Bunnies will always and forever cheer for and support Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haein, and Hyein. 

Thank you.

I really want to say something... but I'm going to refrain.

Why does this actually read like a threat? 

Also, what was the promise? Was it to help NewJeans, or each individual members? Because those are two different things, and one of them does not need 5/5 in a group to keep their side of the bargain.","nos2wnn","icy371","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_nos0xbd",1763110099,40,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nos2wnn/",2025-11-14 08:48:19,2025,11

"This coming off the back of MHJ's statement is really sus, you can already see the narrative they're trying to spin, truly that fandom and their leader is a one trick pony. I suppose they believe the only hope that matters is theirs and the trio? What about the workers at ADOR who would hope they wouldn't pull something like this again or be blamed and thrown under the bus for not worshipping MDH? These people are still acting like it's a pinky promise that was broken so the girls could just show up last minute and say ""Sorry,not sorry but let's just put this all behind us"" and not expect ADOR to side eye them.

>while allowing some entertainment media outlets, which have been biased towards Hybe and hostile towards the members, to publish groundless rumor articles stating that 'ADOR may not accept some members.' We hope the fans' concerns that the agency ADOR may have impure intentions are unfounded.

Still not liking the shoe being on the other foot, I see. When those three were throwing around vague hints and had everybody and their grandmother speculating about the company, it was fine.

Redundacy aside, speaking like it's a forgone conclusion and that nobody but the 5 of them have a say in the matter is laughable. Arrogance second nature to these people.

[**""Freshly-Debuted ILLIT with Weak Fandom Chosen as 'Sacrificial Lamb'/Scapegoat""**](https://m.entertain.naver.com/home/article/003/0013601760)

**Former ADOR CEO Min is alleged to have instructed ADOR employees to compile monitoring documents stating that 'each idol group copied NewJeans' during her tenure as CEO

Belift Lab, the agency of the group 'ILLIT' and a HYBE label, revealed this during the fourth pleading of the damages lawsuit against former CEO Min, which proceeded at the Seoul Western District Court on the 14th.

This lawsuit originated from former CEO Min's claim, made through a press conference and statement on April 25 last year, that Belift Lab plagiarized NewJeans' concept and overall aspects while planning ILLIT.

Belift Lab filed a 2 billion won damages lawsuit against former CEO Min in June of the same year, calling it false defamation. In November of the same year, former CEO Min's side also filed a counter lawsuit worth 5 billion won, and the two sides have been engaged in a dispute during three previous pleadings.

The fourth pleading today garnered more attention as it was held after the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in the exclusive contract validity confirmation lawsuit filed by ADOR against the NewJeans members on the 30th of last month.

This is because the court did not accept the suspicion of ILLIT's plagiarism claimed by the NewJeans side during that lawsuit. The presiding court stated in its ruling, ""It is difficult to conclusively determine that a female idol 'concept' is included in the trademark rights, publicity rights, and intellectual property rights stipulated in an exclusive contract.""

**Belift Lab cited the results of the previous lawsuit between NewJeans and ADOR, pointing out that former CEO Min waged a public opinion campaign against HYBE and its subordinate labels to secure independent control of ADOR** and used the newly debuted youngest group, ILLIT, as a sacrificial lamb at that time.

Belift Lab's side presented the ruling from the NewJeans main lawsuit, stating, ""The raising of plagiarism suspicions against the plaintiff (Belift Lab) was also a preliminary task by the defendant (Min Hee-jin) to form negative public opinion against HYBE.""

**In particular, they submitted as evidence materials KakaoTalk conversations from March 25 last year, among others, showing that former CEO Min and her close associates discussed methods to attack ILLIT,** such as a stockpiling/sajaegi frame and ILLIT plagiarism suspicions, even before ILLIT's debut.

Belift Lab's side argued in their pleading, **""When ILLIT's debut schedule was revealed on February 27 last year, ADOR's Vice President A planned a stockpiling/sajaegi attack of unreleased music at the time to threaten/pressure HYBE, and on March 18, 2024, when ILLIT's debut teaser was released, they showed a maliciously edited slanderous Shorts video about ILLIT to an analyst and induced them to write a 'sell report' telling people to sell HYBE stock.""** *(The unreleased music could be Magnetic I think)

Additionally, Belift Lab also claimed that under former CEO Min's direction, ADOR employees at the time created monitoring documents with the gist that several idol groups had copied NewJeans. They stated, **""Former CEO Min ordered the creation of monitoring documents targeting not only HYBE groups but also groups belonging to other entertainment companies, regardless of gender, and as they concretized the plan, they chose ILLIT, which had just debuted and had a weak fandom, as the sacrificial lamb.""**

Belift Lab further emphasized, **""It appears there was also consideration that by instilling an unfounded fear in the NewJeans parents that perhaps because it's a girl group, it could become a 'substitute' for NewJeans, it would be easy to hide herself in the background and put the NewJeans parents at the forefront.""**

Belift Lab's side stated that **the basis for plagiarism in the copy monitoring document created by former CEO Min's side consisted solely of some community posts and comments and maliciously edited Shorts videos, and they even demonstrated an example video on site** showing how individual movements from choreography can be maliciously cut out for a few seconds each and pieced together to look like copying.

**They also presented as evidence in court the details of former CEO Min's KakaoTalk messages instructing that NewJeans appear alongside Director B, on a popular YouTube channel to imply that other idols were 'NewJeans copycats'.**

Belift Lab's side emphasized, **""Above all, former CEO Min's statement and press conference were nothing more than a public opinion campaign aimed solely at slander for the sake of slander, a reputation takedown, without any objective comparative analysis.""** They then presented a precedent stating that even if some members of the public raised plagiarism suspicions, making plagiarism remarks without an objective verification process constitutes intent for defamation, and pointed out, **""(Former CEO Min's raising of the plagiarism issue) constitutes an illegal act that clearly cannot be protected as freedom of speech.""**

**They also pointed out that former CEO Min was extremely wary of her KakaoTalk content being revealed in court, and argued that this is because there are many clues revealing the purpose of defamation, such as the words 'media' and 'public opinion campaign' appearing multiple times**.

They elaborated, ""The defendant (Min Hee-jin) packaged herself as a righteous whistleblower, positioned herself on the side of good people, incited the public to not even need to listen to the other side's story, and portrayed herself as a victim,"" and added, **""After former CEO Min raised the plagiarism suspicion, ILLIT's album orders plummeted, leading to a halt in additional production, scheduled filming appearances were canceled, advertisement executions were suspended, and the members suffered from malicious comments, incurring immense tangible and intangible damages."" They also presented materials said to be able to support this content.**

Meanwhile, during today's trial, former CEO Min's side again showed a sensitive reaction to the PT that used KakaoTalk messages as evidence. **They argued that ""the KakaoTalk content constitutes an invasion of privacy and it is improper to include it in a public PT."" Consequently, the trial proceeded with the KakaoTalk messages redacted from the PT materials prepared by both sides.**

Separately, **former CEO Min's side submitted written materials on the day of the trial, preventing Belift Lab's side from preparing a rebuttal, for which they (former CEO Min) received a pointed comment from the court that this was problematic.**","nosho5l","thetari","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1763118843,75,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/nosho5l/",2025-11-14 11:14:03,2025,11
"I mean I’m not thrilled about some of these results either, but let’s be realistic.

Teddy has had probably the single most dominant run as a producer/creative head of literally anyone in kpop in *years*, short of maybe like, Dem Jointz. Teddy has been directly or indirectly involved in the production of Allday Project and Meovv (both quite popular in Korea and headed by his protégés), wrote on Jump by Blackpink, produced for IZNA who are generally seen to have great music, and produced or consulted on basically the entire Kpop Demon Hunters soundtrack, which has absolutely dominated the globe since it came out, including Korea. Genuinely kind of a generational run, and I personally strongly dislike the man.

ADP annoys me personally, but they’re very popular in Korea. Them winning something makes sense. 

INI is one of the groups that came from the Produce Japan series, they’re fairly popular, just not in the west.

I knew I would've been a fan of KPDH whether or not if I was a part of it. 

When I landed the singing role of Mystery, I was INCREDIBLY happy to be a part of this project and especially when I heard Soda Pop and Your Idol, I knew they were doing something right. It was just TOO GOOD. I had no idea it would become the most watched movie on Netflix ever, but I knew it was something VERY special and that it was gonna resonate with the right audience. But now, the WHOLE WORLD knows about it, and sometimes that's still hard to process.

"I feel that if MHD choose be humble and cooperate, there is still value in keeping NJ as the original 5. But there is a loooot of groundwork that would need to be conducted first - reworking the contracts, establishing a strict code of conduct, sincere apologies to staff and idols, etc. Keeping them would be an uphill battle when they are willing to cooperate. 

ADOR has to demonstrate that they are making an honest try for the NJ IP. In my eyes, judging by the MHD demand to return + MHJ insisting that NJ is five, just that alone makes retaining them seem like a liability. What's the guarantee they won't wreak havoc and run their mouths publicly again? Heck, what's stopping them from colluding with MHJ even?

And the optics of it to other fandoms too - these girls straight up supported their toxic fandom trashing LSF and Illit, and I include HH in this too. All of them have been complicit in what took place, but at least HH demonstrated some willingness to work things through with ADOR. MHD truly think that they can just unilaterally release a statement and that it would turn magically come true. Until they learn some humility and deprogram themselves, they're too risky to have in positions of power and inside HYBE's building.","noxy2c7","LordessMeep","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_noxng2z",1763189951,25,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/noxy2c7/",2025-11-15 06:59:11,2025,11

"Agreed partially. This is all contingent on MHD humbling themselves and cooperating with ADOR tbh, and the hastily released press note doesn't set a good precedent. Neither does MHJ virtually giving her blessing for them to be 5, when she's been shouting from the rooftops that NJs was mistreated.

Imo ADOR has to only demonstrate that they're conducting their negotiations in good faith and doing everything to the letter to bring NJs back. There's little they can do if MHD don't capitulate to the terms set by them. I also think that if NJ as 5 collectively agree to throw MHJ under the bus, they can start their journey to rehabbing their image. But the way it's looking, I wouldn't be surprised if the older three are in touch with MHJ.

The scrutiny on ADOR atp is huge and there is no way for them to appease all parties, including internal staff who would be reluctant to work with this group directly. Fearnots and Glitts for sure wouldn't be happy and I can see Army also joining in if they're ever dragged into the issue (again). ADOR has overall been methodical and level-headed throughout the ordeal and I have faith that the decision they make won't be made lightly.","np0vvnx","LordessMeep","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_np0soso",1763234284,19,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/np0vvnx/",2025-11-15 19:18:04,2025,11

"Fragments from an [article from MTN](https://news.mtn.co.kr/news-detail/2025111413291728342) \[Machine translation\]:

*After sufficient discussions with the company, Haerin and Hyein decided to respect the court’s ruling and abide by their exclusive contracts, and this news was made public through ADOR’s official statement. In contrast,* ***Minji, Hanni, and Danielle announced their return directly to the media about three hours after the first two members’ return became known.*** *It is reported that they issued their statements independently, without having reached an agreement with the company. (...)*

*ADOR has consistently emphasized that it would fully support the members if they chose to return. Even after the first-trial ruling, the company declared that it had already completed preparations for activities such as releasing a full-length album and was waiting—promising to do everything it could to help NewJeans return to their fans.*

*However, there is a prerequisite.* ***The members must respect the court’s judgment and accept the decision.*** *For the past year, ADOR and NewJeans have taken opposing stances and have been locked in a tense conflict. That kind of discord cannot simply disappear overnight.* ***From ADOR’s perspective, the members need to accept that none of the reasons they claimed were recognized by the court and demonstrate a different attitude before any restoration of trust can begin.***

*ADOR accepted Haerin and Hyein because they showed this attitude. Minji, Hanni, and Danielle must take the same steps for an agreement to be possible. As long as this issue remains unresolved, it is only natural that the company cannot immediately embrace them without conditions.*

***For this reason, it is premature to talk about NewJeans’ full-group return.*** *At present, ADOR is said to be coordinating individual meeting schedules with the three members. Observing how these discussions unfold is expected to provide a clearer picture of NewJeans’ future.*","np1dqi2","MiyaRina","t3_1ojnnsn","t3_1ojnnsn",1763240192,95,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/np1dqi2/",2025-11-15 20:56:32,2025,11
"I read this comment yesterday and this response is late, but I have to chime in and agree with all of this. Personally, I wouldn't have looked into this issue as deep as I did were it not for Jungkook's IG post last year, defending NJ. I've been following most of the case since then and it is wild to me that outside of certain circles, K-Pop fans are not outraged by what MHJ has done. It's not the case of a poor, little creative vs the big bad corporation at all; MHJ has done all of this to feed her greed and ego. She's uses feminist rhetoric to her advantage, uses young artists as shields, and twists anything and everything to benefit herself in any way possible. She literally does not care about anything other than herself. And I can't believe that NJ's own fanbase is perfectly okay with their idols spectacularly tanking their own careers in service of a woman who doesn't care about them. Oh, and let's not forget the people who want to make this a conversation about predatory contracts in K-Pop, conveniently ignoring that NJ themselves benefitted massively from said contracts and that they're free to pay stipulations to get out of it. It's just that they don't want to.

To be very real, with the way that some people hop into this thread and call people expressing any opinion unsupportive of NJ/MHJ as ""company stans"", this whole case is a study in how much K-Pop fans despise HYBE. Less vitriol has been thrown at actual criminals than there has been at BSH/HYBE (lbr, they're apparently synonymous). They care less about the precedent that this case sets for idol contracts going forward and more about how they can take potshots at anything associated with HYBE, including BTS, LSF, and Illit. This is exactly why they love MHJ so much, because she's made it her full-time job to shit on HYBE, being stupid enough to bite the hand that feeds her. 

In fact, more people should be outraged at what LSF and Illit had to go through and primarily because one woman took it on themselves to defame very young groups. Poor Illit didn't even have a chance and LSF debuted first *because* of MHJ's own actions in delaying NJ's debut. Why is it okay to minimise what these equally young girls went through? Somehow, NJ ought to be handled with kid gloves, but LSF and Illit should get over the bullying they went through. Fuck that noise. If this doesn't demonstrate how much people want to hate anything associated with HYBE, I don't know what does.","np7em7i","LordessMeep","t3_1ojnnsn","t1_np2acyj",1763326087,8,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1ojnnsn/megathread_24_hybe_ador_mhj_court_rules_in_favor/np7em7i/",2025-11-16 20:48:07,2025,11

"> I just remembered Jimin has had multiple scares of being cut from the official BTS lineup like THEE Jimin😭

Didn't he train for like six months and was kicked out multiple times during it? 😭 And yet, these things have only ever been mentioned in passing. I can't help but think of Yunjin's WeVerse letter too and how she only vaguely referenced what she was going through, but chose to end the message positively. Which was such a mature way to handle the shitshow she and her group went through for literally existing. Meanwhile, you have NJ dooming and glooming about how unbearably oppressed and marginalised they were while simultaneously deifying MHJ. Bruh, this woman called them - literal girls - fat and stupid (paraphrasing) in messages 🤦🏽‍♀️She does not give two fucks about anyone other than herself.

>I think Tokkis have done the girls a great disservice positioning them as some freedom fighters for the industry, though it is of course not helped with the members themselves thinking the same

100%. I maintain that NJ were failed horribly by the enablers around them - MHJ, their parents, and Tokkis - but have been complicit in the damage caused. Tokkis have by far demonstrated the worst kind of fan behaviour that I have seen in K-Pop fandoms across the board. I'm still in awe that a nebulous claim landed Hanni in the National Assembly... and she used the chance to demonstrate that she doesn't have a stronger claim. Oh, but she will come on a livestream after and insist that she had more to say. Like c'mon, fans or not, you have to realise that it's just empty words.

Also, justice for Illit and LSF because Tokkis will come to bat for their idols being blasted online for behaviour they brought on themselves, but Fearnots and Glitts can't do the same. It's so hypocritical. Because Illit and LSF were young girls too; they didn't deserve the shit they got.

"As someone who came from a overly Christian household (no longer Christian myself), I can explain why some Christians may not like it.

1) some of the demons are portrayed as sympathetic. While I don't know if there is anything in the bible that says you can't sympathise for them, I know that many Christians would see this as a compromise. 

2) the heroes vanquish the demons through their own power, not that of god's.

3) one of the heroes is part demon (or something like that, can't remember).

4) it's eastern, so many Christians will take supernatural eastern stuff as specifically eastern spiritualism.

"A lot of people here are overthinking. As a Brit who has Christian relatives and grew up in a rural area with a heavy church presence, it's most likely nothing to do with obscure scriptural references or complex interfaith relationships.

The backlash was probably a mixture of concern over the presence of demons in the film in the first place and the fact that K-pop and boy bands have always been seen as a bit of a bad influence amongst the religious.

In Britain, even those who go to church regularly or send their children to Christian schools (which are most primary schools in England) are moreso culturally Christian than religiously Christian, and what with all of the ab-flashes and short shorts, it's exactly the kind of thing that's bound to rub them the wrong way.","npm616k","FUYANING","t3_1p0ux4j","t3_1p0ux4j",1763525145,21,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1p0ux4j/school_in_britain_bans_kpop_demon_hunters_songs/npm616k/",2025-11-19 04:05:45,2025,11

CS Lewis was a Christian apologist though, so it's not surprising he was encoding Christian ideas in his fictional work. 

I will say though that in KPop Demon Hunters, the intro montage shows that the girls are ""descendants"" of female exorcists, and specifically show Korean *mudangs*, or shamans. 

Shamanism is the indigenous religion of Korea, so they were probably just trying to create a neat backstory that ties into Korean culture.

K-pop thrives overseas but struggles at home

K-pop continues to draw massive global audiences, but its presence in the domestic music market appears to be weakening. Even as major entertainment companies post record concert revenue from world tours, industry figures say the Korean market is undergoing a structural shift in the wake of the pandemic.

Some observers stop short of calling it a “crisis,” but agree that the domestic landscape is changing while international K-pop projects, including the animated Netflix film “KPop Demon Hunters” and various localized groups, enjoy explosive popularity abroad.

Album sales, one of the clearest indicators of the industry’s health, show the contrast. K-pop album sales climbed steeply after 2014 and topped 100 million units in 2023, a record high. The market correction that followed the pandemic pushed sales down for the first time in a decade, and the decline is expected to continue this year.

“Cumulative sales stood in the low 80 million range as of October, so the full-year total will likely match or fall slightly below last year’s level,” music data journalist Kim Jin-woo said.

Exports of physical albums are also slowing in major markets. According to the Korea Customs Service, album exports from January to October reached $243.8 million, down 2.7 percent from a year earlier.

The figures fall short of expectations given K-pop’s rapid global rise. Exports to Japan, the largest overseas market for Korean albums, dropped 10.8 percent to $70.7 million during the period. Exports to the United States also decreased by 5.1 percent.

The domestic digital music market is experiencing a downturn as well. In the most recent Circle Chart digital rankings for Nov. 9 to 15, only four K-pop tracks — NMIXX’s “Blue Valentine,” LE SSERAFIM's “Spaghetti,” Hwasa’s “Good Goodbye” and BLACKPINK’s “JUMP” — ranked in the top 10.

This contrasts sharply with the height of the girl group boom, when acts such as NewJeans, aespa and IVE dominated the charts. The share of newly released songs near the top has also decreased. “Data on new-song streams, which reflect the latest trends, show slower short-term momentum and a gradual decline in the long-term share of new releases,” Kim said.

Meanwhile, overseas concert revenue is soaring, but rising production costs and rookie-group expenses are cutting into profits. HYBE’s concert sales in the third quarter nearly tripled from a year earlier, but the company still posted an operating loss of 42.2 billion won ($31 million).

Mid-sized agency success stories — once called “miracles” in the industry — are also fading. As the business shifts toward large-scale marketing and global touring, smaller companies are finding it increasingly difficult to operate.

“Overall costs have risen, but album and digital sales have fallen sharply. Revenue from overseas concerts is also limited, so companies without sufficient capital will face greater challenges,” a mid-tier agency official said.

Against this backdrop, groups such as Purple Kiss, Weeekly and Everglow have disbanded or halted activities this year, while H1-KEY, known for its hit “Rose Blossom,” changed agencies.

Experts say the industry’s rapid expansion has made it less flexible and less dynamic.

“With production and marketing costs rising sharply, the space for smaller agencies has shrunk and the industry’s vitality has diminished,"" said pop music critic Lim Hee-yoon. ""Artists are focusing more on overseas markets, and the domestic K-pop fandom appears to be stagnating.”

Pop critic Kim Do-heon added, “As the industry matures, its systems have become more rigid. Instead of repeating old formulas when results fall short, companies need to start making changes, even in small ways.”

"On Wednesday (November 28th), a fire broke out at a high-rise apartment complex that has currently claimed the lives of 128 people and many more are confirmed missing, the worst fire in Hong Kong's history in almost 80 years. There were talks that MAMA would be canceled or delayed in some capacity, until we got confirmation that the show would proceed with a more subdued tone than normal, which includes the altering of songs/lyrics pertaining to fire, removing the use of the color red and pyrotechnics, a moment of silence at the beginning of the show, as well as repeated calls to support the country during these difficult times.

The supposed Saja Boys cover performance was supposed to be for Your Idol, and in the movie,>!the main villain, Gwi-Ma, is depicted as a demonic flaming entity consuming human souls while the Saja Boys would herald the demons' arrival, which definitely would rub viewers the wrong way given the context of recent events, even if its fictional. The song itself isn't inherently bad; its more the visuals of the scene in which the song it's used in during the film.!<","nreouaj","tobi_obito","t3_1p9hn8l","t1_nrdckrx",1764437382,6,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1p9hn8l/the_kpop_demon_hunters_saja_boys_special/nreouaj/",2025-11-29 17:29:42,2025,11

">2. Evidence for future legal action? Some reasons for damages during the contract validity case. After the contract expires, it would definitely be grounds for damages or termination

Hybe has probably already collected every activity from this account, so there isn't much harm in disabling it.

>4. Condition for return? ADOR was looking for a sign of sincerity from MHD, maybe that was it.

I thought this could be like a proof of the members' sincerity, something that demonstrates that the intention to return is genuine.

>7. New lawyers? Sejong is no longer involved and a new law firm is giving better advice to MHJ lawyers

This new law firm has a very different stance than sejong, so they seem to want to do everything as correctly as possible (despite the unilateral return notice) because there is nothing they can do with the damage from last year, so minimizing the damage from now on is a smart approach. The members did not notify the court of the change of law firm during the 13 day appeal period they had, which made me think that they may have decided not to appeal from the beginning or that the change was necessary at some point.","nrox5h2","sunsetflyrise","t3_1p11ofw","t1_nroppnz",1764586895,24,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1p11ofw/megathread_25_hybe_ador_mhj_ador_holds/nrox5h2/",2025-12-01 11:01:35,2025,12

A core K-Pop memory: watching early-2000s K-pop MVs/clips on Metacafe (in their 240/360p glory) on my family’s Dell Pentium 4 desktop PC. K-pop (and Asian pop/media in general) was *very* niche musically in North America at that time, but my friends and I were hooked 😅

20+ years later, and I’m still making K-Pop memories: watching the first run of “K-Pop Demon Hunters: Sing-Along” in movie theatres, me and a new group of friends (plus one of their kids),  proudly belting out the soundtrack with our whole chests during the showing 🥲

That movie blew up, the soundtrack did great, and the high charting success has only amplified TBL’s pull in the industry, so the label has a lot of leverage right now.

[**Ador Side ""Min Hee-jin and Dolphiners Film's Claims of Industry Practices Cannot Be a Free Pass"" [Celebrity On-site]**](http://m.celuvmedia.com/article.php?aid=1765251040511257007)

The Ador side emphasized that the claim of creator industry practice asserted by former Ador CEO Min Hee-jin and the Dolphiners Film side cannot be a free pass.

On the morning of the 9th, the Seoul Central District Court Civil Agreement Division 62 (Presiding Judge Lee Hyun-seok) proceeded with the 4th hearing for the approximately 11 billion won damages claim lawsuit filed by Ador against the external video production company Dolphiners Film and Director Shin Woo-seok.

This lawsuit arose after Dolphiners Film, an external video production company for Ador, released the director's cut video of NewJeans' 'ETA' music video on its own YouTube channel in August last year.
Ador claimed ownership rights to the video in question and subsequently, the videos from another unofficial NewJeans fandom channel operated by Dolphiners Film's Director Shin Woo-seok, the 'Ban Hee-soo Channel,' were deleted all at once.

In relation to this, Director Shin filed a criminal complaint claiming defamation, and Ador filed a damages claim lawsuit for approximately 11 billion won, escalating the legal dispute.

Previously, at the 3rd hearing held on the 11th of last month, Min Hee-jin attended as a witness for the Dolphiners Film side and stated during her cross-examination,""It is generally accepted practice across the industry for a music video director to upload a completed work to their own SNS or website, rather than the agency's SNS or YouTube channel.”

She continued, ""They can enjoy promotional benefits by posting it on their personal channels. Respect for collaborating creators and respect for workers is fundamental,""** and claimed, **""This is an industry where oral agreements are fundamentally the norm. I think finding written cases is more difficult.""

Additionally, she added, ""Service contracts take a long time to prepare and cannot be revised either. The entertainment industry operates tightly, so such cases are also frequent/common. Director Shin Woo-seok also disliked the contract. Entering into a written contract is a very unusual and strange.""

On this day, the plaintiff (Ador) side argued, **""The defendants (Dolphiners Film, Director Shin Woo-seok) also claim there was no dispute over verbal agreements in the related case. However, even in the exclusive contract case between the plaintiff and Min Hee-jin, a clause regarding verbal agreements is unnecessary. The respective judges in the related cases, after examining all this, ruled that even if there was an oral agreement or oral discussion, it had no effect in determining prior written consent.""**

They further explained, **""The defendants claim there was an oral agreement to change the service contract terms requiring prior written consent, thus asserting a so-called dual/double oral agreement. In the first hearing, the defendants also claimed to have had an oral agreement to post the video. When questioned whether they meant they agreed to change the contract terms, they suddenly fabricated the claim of a double/dual oral agreement. The previously submitted statement of facts prepared by Min Hee-jin and her associates contains no mention of an agreement to allow verbal changes to the contract term.""**

Also, they stated, **""Since the contract clearly states that contract terms can only be changed by written agreement, for an oral change agreement to be valid, there must be clear evidence demonstrating the contracting parties explicitly expressed their intent to change the agreement to a degree equivalent to written documentation., but the defendants have failed to present such evidence.""**

They continued, **""Considering the size/scale of the victimized company, its position in the market, sales revenue, the extent of credit damage, the impact on business/operations, and so forth, we anticipated a large amount of damages. We earnestly request the court to acknowledge sufficient damages, taking into account that the plaintiff's image has been seriously damaged due to the defendants' actions, to prevent recurrence of such incidents in the future.""**

Later, in the closing argument, the plaintiff side stated, **""After joining Ador in August 2024 and examining matters, we found that during former CEO Min Hee-jin's era, there were many instances where works/operations were handled not in accordance with contracts or company regulations,""** and **""This case is one of them. Ms. Min Hee-jin and Director Shin Woo-seok claim they 'are creators and thus do not know contracts well, and that it differs from the creator industry's practice,' but the name 'creator' cannot be a free pass to not comply with laws and contracts.""**

They added, **""K-pop has become a core industry of the Republic of Korea enjoying global popularity. NewJeans is a girl idol group representing the Republic of Korea. The plaintiff is doing its best to ensure management is advanced accordingly,""** and **""We believe the Korean entertainment industry must operate normally for the current popularity of K-pop to be sustainable. We earnestly request the court to fully consider these circumstances.""**

Meanwhile, the final judgment for this damages claim lawsuit is scheduled for **January 13, 2026, at 2:15 PM.**","nt25mwz","thetari","t3_1p11ofw","t3_1p11ofw",1765253694,65,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1p11ofw/megathread_25_hybe_ador_mhj_ador_holds/nt25mwz/",2025-12-09 04:14:54,2025,12

"There’s an article in Rolling stone about bots being used to cause misinformation about Taylor swift and it briefly mentions that the same bots were against Blake. It’s interesting to see that coming out at the same time. 

Here’s the relevant part:
> “The internet is fake,” says Keith Presley, GUDEA’s founder and CEO, only half-jokingly. He notes that some 50 percent of the web is now made up of bots. “This is something that we’ve seen escalate on our corporate side — this type of espionage, or working to damage someone’s reputation.”

While Presley and his team don’t know the identity of the individual or group behind this attack, they did discover “a significant user overlap between accounts pushing the Swift ‘Nazi’ narrative and those active in a separate astroturf campaign attacking Blake Lively,” according to the paper. The actress has claimed in an ongoing sexual harassment lawsuit that actor and director Justin Baldoni organized a chorus of smears against her on social media as the two waged a bitter legal and PR war over the troubled production of their 2024 film It Ends With Us. Their data, GUDEA researchers wrote in their report, “reveals a cross-event amplification network, one that disproportionately influences multiple celebrity-driven controversies and injects misinformation into otherwise organic conversations.” 

The intersection of networks and the similarity of their strategies across two separate topics demonstrate a certain “sophistication” in the expanding industry of facilitating reputational harm across social media, Presley says. “They know what they’re doing,” he adds.

"There are like... 3 songs on that list that are actually good, and only one (Hunter) that deserves to be in the top 25. 🤨

NCT DREAM released 2 albums this year on which each individual track is better than this entire list combined. NCT WISH and P1Harmony also released 2 excellent albums each—we're now up to 6 projects that've been entirely snubbed when their quality (and popularity) is vastly superior to almost every song on this list. 🤡 

No TXT or ZEROBASEONE? WayV? Cravity? NEXZ? AHOF? CYE? XLOV? TEN? HAECHAN? All of these groups and soloists have released excellent music in 2025—music that far surpasses in quality what the ignorami at NME thought were the 25 ""best"" KPOP songs of the year. NMIXX's and BLACKPINK's music couldn't be more mediocre and uninspiring, yet everyone and their mother (this sub included) won't stop slobbering all over it sloppy-style... Please, enough.

At the end of the day, it all comes down to personal preference, and people (NME included) are entitled to enjoy all the bad music they want, but holy shit is it painfully hard to live life as one of the apparently very few people with good taste and functioning ears.

* I like that Hearts2Hearts made the list, but it should have been Focus. 
* High Horse isn't my cup of tea, but I like that NMIXX made the list twice. 
* Eww at Jump and Like Jennie being on here, double eww for Like Jennie being that high, especially over songs like Hunter and Ash.

"Really interesting what they said about it, idk if i would personnaly rank it number 1 but I like what they side about it.

>KPop Demon Hunters grew from a genre fan curiosity to a pop culture-conquering phenomenon so rapidly it can be easy to forget just how unlikely it was. An animated musical with no big-name voice actors, based around a genre with passionate but extremely protective fans, whose stars — even some of the very biggest ones — have found difficulty crossing over to the most mainstream American spaces? There were a million ways that could go wrong, and only one way that it really could go right: The songs were gonna have to be very, very, very good.

>Luckily for KPop Demon Hunters, they had the right people on the case — from globe-spanning behind-the-scenes fixtures like Teddy Park and Mark Sonnenblick to help with the writing and production, to established (and Korean-rooted) singers EJAE, Audrey Nuna and REI AMI to provide the voices. And soon enough, they had the right songs: particularly “Golden,” which became the triumphant, chart-dominating signature anthem for the movie’s heroes HUNTR/X, both inside and outside of the film’s fictional universe.

>The beauty of “Golden” was that, of course, it was the perfect HUNTR/X song. It’s aspirational, in the grand tradition of Disney “I Want” songs, but fittingly for a group of superheroes, it also feels inevitable — “We’re going up, up, up, it’s our moment,” EJAE-as-Rumi declares on the chorus, leaving no room for doubt. (And with the high notes she hits at the chorus’ climax, anyone listening is sure to take her word for it.) Meanwhile, the song’s propulsive drums and glistening synths make the entire thing feel like an Olympic awards ceremony, with the trio singing and dancing at the gold-medal podium, as the Saja Boys no doubt sulk silently on either side of them.

>But the real miracle of “Golden” is that you don’t need to already be a fan of KPop Demon Hunters — or really even of K-pop in general — to love it. It’s thrived in all the spaces (at the Grammys, on radio, even on certain dancefloors) where previous Disney and movie anthems failed, because they were too inextricably tied to their source soundtracks. Which isn’t to say that “Golden” won’t also be forever associated with KPDH, or that it would’ve been as big a hit without it. But the song is so glorious, and its ascent has taken it so high up, that it’s largely broken free of the movie’s orbit: Now it’s just the best, most exciting pop song of 2025, enjoying its moment all on its own. — A.U.","ntompjc","Fabulous_Potential41","t3_1pk417u","t3_1pk417u",1765562925,2,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1pk417u/golden_by_huntrx_ejae_rei_ami_audrey_nuna_from/ntompjc/",2025-12-12 18:08:45,2025,12

"Demon slayer made $70M its 1st opening weekend in the US.....thats better than alot of american block buster releases.....and its released in September (which gives it a decent qualifying chance but unlikely). 

Zootopia 2 came out less than a month ago....and its built by the hype of the 1st movie.

Here are the specific requirements for Oscar nominations: To qualify for the Oscars, a movie (feature-length, over 40 mins) must have a limited theatrical release in specific US cities (LA, NYC, etc.) in the prior calendar year, with paid, prime-time screenings, meeting specific digital/film projection standards, and then complete an expanded run for Best Picture. 

In order for you to even qualify you have to have had a certain amount of tickets sold even if limited in theatrical release to qualify for 2025 Oscar's. Usually the nomination run period starts early in January or February (start of the year) and up until September or October. If you have something screenings in October or November your out of the qualifying zone and would be nominated maybe for the following year. Kpop demon hunters opened in limited theaters in August and started streaming in late june. Which makes it qualify.","nuf3gsf","Euctice_Pea46821","t3_1pobd0a","t1_nuetvex",1765926894,-14,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1pobd0a/golden_from_kpop_demon_hunters_is_officially/nuf3gsf/",2025-12-16 23:14:54,2025,12

"> If you have something screenings in October or November your out of the qualifying zone and would be nominated maybe for the following year.

No, it can open any time during the calendar as long as it then runs for one consecutive week. A movie can come out on New Year's Eve and still qualify. The only exceptions are short films and international features. 

> you have to have had a certain amount of tickets sold

There's no requirement for a specific number of tickets sold- there just have to be tickets available for purchase.

"Team Bunnies finally [released a statement](https://m.asiatime.co.kr/article/20251217500080#_mobwcvr%23_enliple) about Belift lawsuit (translated with ChatGPT)

On the 17th, the NewJeans fandom said that there had been reports stating that on the 11th, Belift Lab, a subsidiary of HYBE, filed a 100 million won damages lawsuit against the NewJeans fandom group “Team Bunnies,” and asserted, “The case has not even been assigned to a court yet, which leads us to suspect that the information was obtained from HYBE.”

They went on to say, “There were reports questioning the identity of the NewJeans fandom, but such claims show a lack of understanding of how K-pop fandom activities are structured,” adding, “This protest statement, the truck demonstrations, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism fax campaign, and last year’s National Assembly audit fax campaign were each led by different fans. For HYBE, who could not possibly be unaware of this, to shift responsibility onto a specific individual and pursue lawsuits and a media battle is, in effect, an attempt to pressure and intimidate the NewJeans fandom,” they explained.

In conclusion, Bunnies stated, “We express deep regret that HYBE, instead of reassuring worried and concerned NewJeans fans, has been indiscriminately filing civil and criminal lawsuits against fans while delaying for over a month the official confirmation of NewJeans’ return as a complete group.” They continued, “HYBE should clearly state its official position regarding the full five-member lineup of NewJeans — Minji, Hanni, Danielle, Haerin, and Hyein — and first and foremost faithfully fulfill its duty to protect its artists.”

Meanwhile, it has been reported that on the 11th, Belift Lab filed a 100 million won damages lawsuit at the Seoul Western District Court against Mr. A, identified as the operator of Team Bunnies and reportedly a minor, as well as the parents who have a duty to supervise him. Previously, Team Bunnies repeatedly posted content claiming that ILLIT plagiarized NewJeans, allegedly damaging the reputations of ILLIT and Belift Lab, and the lawsuit seeks compensation for the resulting business losses.

Team Bunnies is one of the NewJeans fandom groups and had previously introduced itself as a team made up of NewJeans fans working across various fields such as the legal profession, media, finance, and culture and the arts. Since then, the group has continued activities claiming to represent NewJeans members, including raising donations to report fake news and malicious posts about the members, releasing a self-developed system for monitoring malicious comments, and sending large volumes of complaint faxes to the office of the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism.

In particular, it has been reported that Team Bunnies previously filed a criminal complaint against Kim Tae-ho, CEO of Belift Lab, based on his remarks in a media interview stating that “the planning concepts for ILLIT and NewJeans are completely different.” The group is currently holding a truck protest in front of HYBE’s headquarters, demanding the protection of the NewJeans members.","nugi58j","Wooden-Owl-568","t3_1p11ofw","t3_1p11ofw",1765945265,44,0,NA,"kpop","/r/kpop/comments/1p11ofw/megathread_25_hybe_ador_mhj_ador_holds/nugi58j/",2025-12-17 04:21:05,2025,12
