## Installation Steps

**It is very important to install in order: first R, then R Studio**

1. **Install R** from the download [link](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html). You can pick which mirror to choose. For example, Duke Mirror: https://archive.linux.duke.edu/cran/

2. **Install R Studio** (free desktop version) **AFTER** you installed R, from the [link](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/). You will only use R Studio but need to have both on your computer.

### Step 4: Running commands

Commands in R Studio can be written directly into the console area (bottom left), or in the script. To run a completed command press **Control + Enter** (Windows/Linux) or **Command + Enter** (Mac).

### Step 5: Install Required Packages

Type the following code in the script and run it:

```r
install.packages("tidyverse")    # data wrangling
install.packages("tidyr")        # data wrangling
install.packages("tidytext")     # text analysis
install.packages("dplyr")        # data wrangling
install.packages("tm")           # topic modeling
install.packages("topicmodels")  # topic modeling
install.packages("quanteda")     # text analysis
install.packages("lubridate")    # dates
install.packages("ggplot2")      # visualizations
install.packages("ggthemes")     # visualizations
install.packages("scales")       # visualizations
install.packages("wesanderson")  # visualizations
```


### Step 6: Load Packages into Library

After installation, load the packages before using them:

```r
library(tidyverse)
library(tidytext)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(tm)
library(topicmodels)
library(quanteda)
library(lubridate)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(scales)
library(wesanderson)
```


### Step 7: Getting Help

For help with any command, type `?` followed by the command name and run:

```r
?merge
?ggplot
?install.packages
```
