## Welcome

Welcome to **Social Data Analysis and Visualization** (Masters) and **Computer-Assisted Text Analysis** (PhD)!

As researchers, we now have various big data and tools to learn about human behavior and nature. With the growth of electronic sources such as cell phones, online messaging platforms, and applications, every second new data is being added globally. This course provides a hands-on tutorial on introductory methods in Computational Social Science, which can be used in academic research and the non-academic industry specializing in data science.

## Course Information

**Instructor:** Dr. Ayse D. Lokmanoglu  
**Email:** [alokman@bu.edu](mailto:alokman@bu.edu)  
**Office Hours:** Wednesdays 10:00 am - 1:30 pm

**Teaching Assistant:** Max Wong, [maxwong@bu.edu](mailto:maxwong@bu.edu)

## Course Goals

The course has three main goals:

1. **Technical Skills**: Introduce students to R Studio and methods of text-mining and analysis
2. **Critical Thinking**: Connect theory and methods while discussing ethical and practical concerns
3. **Independent Learning**: Prepare students with skills to adapt to evolving methodologies and programming languages

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will be able to:

- Understand various computational methods available to social scientists
- Implement these methods in social science research
- Be aware of ethical and practical concerns with these methods
- Use these methods in current and future research
- Develop independent learning and problem-solving skills
